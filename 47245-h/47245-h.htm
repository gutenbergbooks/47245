<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>It has been the business of my life to teach history: and
the informal division of labour which comes to pass in a
University has led me to pay special attention to the military
side of it. This aspect of history involves much comparison
of statements and weighing of evidence, and is therefore
calculated to be very useful to those for whom the study of
history is, not their permanent occupation, but the means
of completing their mental training. Campaigns and battles
present in an exceptionally clear shape the stock problems
of history, what was done, why it was done, what were the
results, what ought to have been done, what would have
been the consequences if this or that important detail had
been different.</p>

<p>It is however not easy to gain from books a clear general
idea of a campaign or a battle, harder perhaps than to obtain
a similar grasp of the work of a legislator, or of the drift of
a social change. To the ordinary historian the military side
is only one aspect of his theme, and very possibly an aspect
which interests him but little. He narrates the facts as
given him by his authorities: but when these are vague,
as medi√¶val writers mostly are, or discrepant, as modern
writers are who mean to be precise and write from different
standpoints, he need be something of an expert to make his
narrative lifelike. On the other hand, purely military works
are, very reasonably, technical: they are written for experts,
to whom the technical language is familiar, and they often
go into considerable detail. Ordinary readers are apt, consequently,
to want help in obtaining from them a clear idea
of the outline of events. Like Pindar's poetic shafts, they
are &#966;&#969;&#957;&#8118;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#963;&#953;&#957;, &#7952;&#962; &#948;&#8050; &#964;&#959;&#960;&#8048;&#957; &#7953;&#961;&#956;&#951;&#957;&#8051;&#969;&#957; &#967;&#945;&#964;&#8055;&#950;&#949;&#953;.</p>

<p>Having experienced these difficulties myself, both as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>student and as teacher, I have thought that I might render
some service by trying to act as interpreter, and to describe
the chief military events of English history in a way which
shall not be technical, but yet shall bring out their meaning.
I do not write for experts, though it is they who must judge
whether I have described correctly. I write for those who
do not know much about battles, and would like to understand
events which are interesting in themselves, and are
great turning-points in history: they must judge whether I
have described intelligibly. If I have met the proverbial
fate of those who sit on two stools, it is not for want of
pains in trying to keep my balance.</p>

<p>I feel that it is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</i> presumptuous for a civilian to
write what is in some sense a military book: but after all
it is the customer who feels where the shoe pinches. Moreover
many of the battles of English history occurred in past
ages, in relation to which the professional training of a
modern soldier would teach him little beyond the permanent
principles of strategy, which every educated man should
understand. Given also an elementary knowledge of tactics,
which has spread pretty widely in this country since volunteering
began and the war-game became popular, a civilian
ought to be able to deal adequately with Hastings and
Crecy, with Towton and Marston Moor, if not with the
campaigns of Marlborough and Wellington. If I have
failed, it is not because the subject is outside the province
of a civilian, but because the writer has been unequal to
his task.</p>

<p><i>Si vis pacem, para bellum</i> is a sound maxim for statesmen:
for ordinary citizens it may be paraphrased thus&mdash;the
better you understand war, the more you will desire
peace. I have found that soldiers' love for peace, and
horror of war, is usually in proportion to their experience:
they deem no sacrifice too heavy to secure the greatest of
national blessings. I think therefore that it is reasonable
for one who belongs to a profession pre-eminently peaceful,
to attempt to aid his countrymen in realising what war
means. The better they understand this, the less they will
be tempted to enter on war lightly, the more they will feel
how amply worth while is every effort to put their country
beyond the risk of attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<p>I wish here to acknowledge a great debt of gratitude to
my friend <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Cooper King, formerly Professor of Tactics
at Sandhurst, who has not only taken great trouble in
drawing the maps to suit my scheme, but has also obtained
for me useful information, besides helping me with some
valuable suggestions and much friendly criticism. I would
not however do him the ill service of sheltering myself
behind his authority as an expert. The faults of my work,
whatever they are, are mine and not his, though they might
well have been more numerous without his assistance.</p>

<p>I have made no reference to the naval battles of English
history, hardly less numerous than the great land battles,
and, two or three of them at least, even more important.
To deal with them adequately would require knowledge to
which I cannot pretend. Moreover they might best be
treated on a separate plan, similar perhaps to that which I
have followed, but entirely distinct from it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>INTRODUCTION</small></h2>


<p>Battles are the most generally interesting class of events
in history, and not without reason. Until mankind have all
been reduced to a single pattern, which would put an end
to history, there will be conflicting interests, sentiments,
creeds, principles, which will from time to time lead to war.
We may settle many disputes peacefully by mutual concession,
or by voluntary submission to external arbitration: but
an appeal to arms always lies behind, and is the only resource
when differences go too deep for reconciliation, or
when the self-respect of nations is too severely wounded.
Even within a nation there are many possibilities, remote
perhaps yet never unimaginable, which may bring about
civil war. And though it is perfectly conceivable that a
given war may be waged to the end without a single important
battle, if the superior skill of one side enables it to
gain overwhelming advantage without fighting, yet practically
this does not happen. Battles are in fact the decisive events
in the contests which are of sufficient moment to grow into
war. It is very easy to exaggerate their importance, to fix
attention on the climax only, and lose sight of the events
which led up to it, and which went very far in most cases
towards determining its result. But after all the battle is
the climax, and the world in general may be forgiven for
over-estimating it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>Writers, whose humane instincts have been outraged by
the way in which other people ignore the horrors of war,
and dwell only on its glories, have sometimes argued that
wars settle nothing, as they only leave behind a legacy of
hatred which tends to fresh wars. No doubt in some cases,
and in a certain sense, this is true. Napoleon trampled
Prussia under foot at Jena, and the spirit engendered in the
Prussian government and people by their ignominious defeat
brought about in course of time the war of 1870, in which
France in her turn was crushed almost as ruthlessly, to cherish
ever since a hope of revenge. Still Jena was decisive for
the time, and Sedan for a still longer period; and there is
nothing to prove that France and Germany may not be
the best of friends one day. If peaceful accord at one time
does not prevent a future quarrel should circumstances
alter, no more does past hostility prevent future alliance.
Austria and Prussia were permanent, apparently natural,
enemies during a century and a half, except when the
common danger from Napoleon forced them into tardy and
unwilling union; now their alliance is paraded as the
permanent guarantee of the peace of Europe. Russia
contributed more than any other power, except perhaps
England, to the destruction of that fabric of universal empire
with which Napoleon dazzled the French. Forty years
later, another Napoleon joined England in making war on
Russia and humbling her in the Crimea: now France and
Russia advertise their enthusiastic attachment to each other.
This is however only to say that men's interests will often be
stronger motives of action than their passions; and if the
interests of two nations conflict again in the present, as they
have done in the past, their animosity will be all the keener
for the memories of past defeats sustained at each other's
hands.</p>

<p>Is it then undesirable that the memory of past wars should
be fostered? Does it produce nothing but a longing for
revenge on the part of those who have suffered defeat, a
sentiment of vainglory on the part of the victors? Is the
roll of English victories over France to breed in us nothing
but an arrogant notion that an Englishman is worth three
Frenchmen, an inference which the mere numbers engaged
at Crecy or Agincourt, if we knew no more, might seem to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>justify? There is some danger that this may be the case,
if we remember only the battles, the points of decisive
collision, and take no heed to the wars as a whole, and to
the contemporary conditions generally. An isolated battle
is like a jewel out of its setting; it may look very brilliant,
but no use can be made of it. The glories of Sluys and
Crecy, of Trafalgar and Waterloo, would be a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">damnosa
hereditas</i> indeed, if they led us to despise our neighbours and
possible enemies.</p>

<p>Battles however which are not isolated, but are fitted into
their places in the wars to which they belong, and sufficiently
linked together to make them illustrate the political and
social changes from age to age which are reflected in the
changes of armament, may be a subject of study both
interesting and instructive. Detailed narratives of the
battles themselves appeal to the imagination in more ways
than one. There is the romantic element, not merely the
"pomp and circumstance of glorious war," and the feats of
brilliant courage which are often admired out of all proportion
to their utility, but also the occasional startling surprises.
What drama ever contained a more thrilling incident than
the battle of Marengo, changed in a moment from a more
than possible French defeat into a complete victory, through
a sudden cavalry charge causing the panic rout of an
Austrian column up to that moment advancing successfully?
And there is the personal interest of noting how one man's
great qualities, skill, promptitude, forethought, fertility of
resource, in all ages, bodily powers also in the days before
gunpowder, lift him above his fellows, and enable him
visibly to sway their destinies&mdash;how the rashness and incompetence
of another entail speedy and visible punishment.
And behind and above all, is the great fact which
of itself suffices to justify the universal interest, that the
lives of the combatants are at stake. "All that a man hath
will he give for his life;" yet the call of duty, or zeal for his
cause, induces the soldier to expose his life to danger, never
insignificant, and often most imminent and deadly; and
discipline enables him to do this coolly, and therefore with
the best prospects, not of escaping the sacrifice, but of
making it effectual. The admiration of the soldier which
is caricatured in the nursery-maid's love for a red coat is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>obviously silly, but the demagogue's denunciation of him
as a bloodthirsty hireling is equally foolish, and far more
mischievous.</p>

<p>If detailed narratives are to be fitted into their historical
place, the first question that suggests itself is why battles
were fought where they were. The exact site is usually a
matter of deliberate choice on the part of one combatant or
the other, the assailant seizing his enemy at a disadvantage
as he crosses a river, for instance, or the defendant selecting
what seems to him the best position in which to await
attack; and what position is most favourable obviously
depends on the tactics of the age. Of the latter Hastings
and Waterloo furnish conspicuous examples; of the former
the clearest instance in English history is Tewkesbury. The
locality however, as distinguished from the exact spot, is
determined by a variety of considerations. Some are geographical:
the formation of the country, which includes not
only the direction and character of rivers and chains of
hills, but also the position of towns and forests and the
course of roads, limits in various ways the movements of
armies. Some may be called political: the course of events
practically compels the attempting of a particular enterprise.
For instance, the battle of Bannockburn had to be
fought because Stirling Castle was to be surrendered to the
Scots, if an English army did not relieve it by a given day.
The majority of the considerations involved are however
strategical; and it is worth while to attempt to make clear
what is implied by this often misapplied word.</p>

<p>Strategy is the art of moving an army to advantage, so
that either when it comes to fight it may do so on favourable
terms, or it may gain ground on the enemy without
fighting. An invasion so directed as to give the invader
the command of the resources of a rich district, or to
deprive the enemy of access to an important harbour, is
an instance of the latter form of strategic movement. The
former and commoner form, so moving as to compel the
enemy to fight at some disadvantage, may take either of
two shapes, or may involve both. There are two elements
to be considered in comparing the situation of the combatants
before a decisive battle. Which side has the best
chance of winning? This depends mainly on the relative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>strength that can be brought into the field. To which side
will the consequences of defeat be most serious? This
depends mainly on the position of the two armies in the
theatre of war. James <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr> of Scotland, when the battle of
Flodden was fought, had allowed Surrey to get between him
and Scotland: here a defeat meant destruction. Henry <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr>
was in a similar strait before Agincourt, but in this case
victory in the field extricated him from danger. Obviously
one of two combatants may begin with very inferior
strength to his opponent; in that case he will probably be
obliged to stand on the defensive, and his strategy must be
directed to making the most of his force, to doing the best
he can with very small numbers for minor purposes, to
avoiding battle until he can equalise matters somewhat,
and bring as large a proportion as possible to bear on the
decisive point. Obviously also one side may have an
advantage over the other derived from geography; for
instance, one may have, while the other has not, a great
fortress near the common frontier, which will serve as a
starting point for invasion. A general has to take the facts
as he finds them, and make the best of them. He is the
most skilful strategist who gains the most without fighting,
and who succeeds in shifting the balance most largely in his
own favour before engaging in decisive battle.</p>

<p>Changes in tactics again are matters of great interest
from age to age, not merely in themselves, but in connection
with other developments on which at first sight they
seem to have no bearing. Primarily they are matters of
intellectual progress: the invention of gunpowder was an
event of incalculable importance in human history. Similarly
the material progress exemplified in making good
roads brought with it the possibility of supplying an army
in the field, instead of its being compelled to subsist on the
country; and the possibility of doing this presently became
a virtual necessity, because the best supplied army had a
visible advantage. Thus gradually, through the progress of
civilisation, armies have become highly elaborate machines,
which require to be continuously supplied with food, ammunition,
clothing, all the material without which they cannot
act effectually. Hence they need to keep up continuous
communication with their base of operations: and the conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of strategy have been proportionally altered and
rendered more complicated.</p>

<p>There are other changes in tactics, that is to say in
equipment and mode of fighting, which may be called
political: and it is not always easy to see whether they are
the causes, or the effects, of social and political changes;
possibly they are both. In the early middle ages, the
feudal aristocracy was dominant politically, the mailed
knights were preponderant on the battle-field. When infantry
had learned on the continent of Europe to repel
mailed cavalry with the pike, in England to destroy them
with the clothyard arrow, the political supremacy of the
feudal nobles waned along with their military superiority:
their overthrow was consummated when the development
of artillery placed feudal castles at the mercy of the
crown. Inasmuch as political power must in the last
resort depend on physical force, it is plain that the nature
of the armed strength of a nation at any time will be
an important element in determining the nature of its
government.</p>

<p>There are also lessons to be learnt from battles which
may roughly be called moral. Frederick the Great remarked
cynically that, so far as he had observed, Providence was
always on the side of the strongest battalions: and if the
phrase be given sufficient width of interpretation it is perfectly
true. No man ever exhibited more clearly than
Frederick that strength has many elements. Discipline,
endurance, mobility, courage, are all important constituents
of military strength, as also is the relative excellence of
armament. Soldiers who can be trusted not to lose their
heads, either from eagerness or from panic, are worth far
more in the long run than more excitable men. The
bulldog, that never relaxes his grip but in death, is a more
formidable opponent, weight for weight, than the tiger.
Still more valuable is the iron tenacity which is capable of
fighting after all hope is lost: it may apparently succumb, but
such defeat is worth many a victory. The Spartans at Thermopylae
were cut to pieces, but they taught the Persian
king what Greeks could do, and prepared the way for his
headlong flight when his fleet was beaten at Salamis: and
the English in the Indian Mutiny enforced the same lesson.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>The individuals are lost to their country, but their death is
worth more than many lives.</p>

<p>English history is in many ways well suited for illustrating
the lessons that may be learnt from battles and their setting.
It is continuous beyond any other national history of even
moderate length. Englishmen of to-day have more in common
with the axemen of Harold than Frenchmen of to-day
have with the horsemen of Cond√©. Hence it is easier in
England than elsewhere to see the significance of the
changes, social and political, which accompany the military
changes. The Norman feudal cavalry overcome the Saxon
foot-soldiers, and the long-bow presently discomfits the
lance; artillery makes medi√¶val walls worthless: the musket
and pike supersede the bow, and the invention of the bayonet
combines pike and musket in one. Later still have come
enormous extension of the range of fire, both for infantry
and artillery, the invention of new explosives and other
engines of destruction, the effects of which are still matters
of conjecture. Happily more than a generation has passed
since British troops fought on a European battle-field: we
have not yet tried long range artillery and machine guns,
and cordite and melinite, and the other deadly things that
end in -ite, except on a very small scale and against inferior
races. But all the previous stages are reflected in our history
of a thousand years, to go no further back than Alfred, and
in some instances with very special significance.</p>

<p>Moreover English history is on the whole a history of
success. We have suffered defeat from time to time, but
the last crushing rout of a considerable army even mainly
English, which history records, occurred nearly six centuries
ago at the hands of our kindred the Scots, who have long
since become our fellow-citizens. Why this has been the
case is obvious enough; and the battle-fields point the
moral very distinctly. First of all the English obtained a
coherence of organisation and of feeling which entitled
them to be called a nation, as that word is understood now-a-days,
centuries before any other peoples of modern Europe;
and the military value of that advantage is the foremost
lesson of the so-called Hundred Years' War with France.
Secondly, "the English don't know when they are beaten,"
as a great enemy said, in scorn for the stupidity of men who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>would fight on without perceiving that their opponents had
gained tactical advantages, which to the quicker apprehension
of some troops would have meant defeat. Such stupidity
however is very difficult to distinguish from the dogged
resolution which will not give way while life remains: and
the quality, by whichever name it is called, is very apt to
win. It needs no words to show that the lessons deducible
from battles are more obvious to the victors; the losers
have a great temptation to see only what may serve to excuse
or palliate their defeat.</p>

<p>It may be added that in English history there is a considerable
proportion of civil war, where the purely military
aspect of things is not obscured by the possible or probable
results of diversity of race. The conquest of India is also
unique in history, for the mode in which it was achieved as
well as for its extent. Thus English history gives every
variety&mdash;its long continuity spreads its great battles over
eight centuries, and those battles have been fought against
European equals, in internal conflict, against the alien races
of India. The only experience which England has not had
is that of one armed nation precipitating itself on another;
from this we are happily preserved by the narrow seas.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>HASTINGS</small></h2>


<p>It is probably needless to say that Hastings was not the
first battle of English history. The Romans met with
desperate resistance in more than one locality before they
could complete their conquest of Britain: indeed it was not
completed at all, for the wild tribes of the Scottish highlands
never submitted. Details are scantily given: some of the
principal scenes of conflict cannot even be identified with
any certainty. But any one who desires to know how our
British ancestors fought against the Romans may feel sure
that the narratives given by Caesar of his battles with the
Gauls afford a pretty faithful picture of the battles fought by
the Celts on this side of the Channel. He may even be
content with newspaper accounts of the fighting in Africa
between English troops and Soudanese, or Zulus, or Matabeles.
The picture of the fierce enthusiasm, the desperate
courage, of untrained savages dashing themselves to pieces
against the coolness of disciplined troops armed with
superior weapons, is essentially the same, whether the
legionaries use the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pilum</i> or the Maxim gun.</p>

<p>So too, after the Romans had quitted Britain, and the
Angles and Saxons came pouring across the narrow seas,
the contest between them and the Britons was in some
localities most stubborn. The scanty but reasonably trustworthy
information which we possess indicates this clearly
enough: the kingdom of Wessex in particular extended
itself westward very gradually and at the cost of serious
battles. The localities of some of these are known, and the
geographical and other reasons which led to their taking
place on these fields may be fairly well inferred. But of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>detail there is none, though we may safely conclude that
the "dim weird battle of the west" in Tennyson's <cite>Morte
d'Arthur</cite>, which belongs to this age so far as it has other
than ideal existence, was totally unlike, except for the fury
of hand-to-hand conflict, any actual encounter between
British king and heathen invaders leagued with his own
rebel subjects.</p>

<p>Similarly when the Anglo-Saxon conquest was complete,
and the new kingdoms began to contend for mastery among
themselves, there were many bloody battles, some of them
of real importance to the history of our island, as marking
the decisive points in the severe struggle between Christian
Northumbria and heathen Mercia, but little or nothing
more than their names is known. Hume in a well-known
passage cites with apparent approval the saying of a greater
man than himself, to the effect that the battles of the
Heptarchy period were of no more interest than the conflicts
of kites and crows. If this be overstated from the point of
view of their permanent results, it is impossible to dispute
its truth relatively to the military aspect of these wars.
Little as is known about them, there is every reason to
believe that the art of war formed no exception to the general
rudeness and ignorance of the age.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Indeed there is positive
evidence, in the fact that the first Danish invaders, who
appeared before England had come to own a single ruler,
found the English far their inferiors in arms, in skill, in
everything but mere courage. The English had no coherent
organisation, no practice in combined warfare, no defensive
armour. Hence they were no match for the pirates, clad in
mail shirt and iron cap, trained to rapid movement, and
prompt to defend themselves behind rudely constructed
fortifications when hard pressed.</p>

<p>Gradually the scene changed. The Danes who had
begun as mere marauders, landing here and there to plunder
and destroy and then return to their ships, remained in the
land as conquering settlers. The English gradually adopted
arms and equipment similar to those of their enemies, and
learned to encounter them on equal terms. By degrees the
Saxon kings of Wessex (their power, like good metal, rendered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>tougher by the hammering it had received from the Danes)
became the effective rulers over the main part of the island,
over Angles, Saxons and Danes alike, and at least nominally
supreme over the Celtic fringe in the north and west.
Gradually too the organisation took somewhat of a feudal
character. The free ceorl bound by the general law to
appear in arms for the defence of the country, becomes the
"man" of a lord, bound to serve at his call. The Danish
Cnut, who won the English crown by the sword after a long
conflict in which there are no military differences traceable
between Saxon and Dane, but who was in the end fully
accepted by both alike, carried the approximation to
feudalism still further. He divided England into great
earldoms, resembling only too closely the duchies of
Normandy and Burgundy in their tendency to become both
hereditary and practically independent. When the Danish
dynasty died out, the weakness of the restored Saxon king
worked for good in one respect: the power of the crown
was virtually wielded by Godwine, the ablest of the earls,
and by his greater son after him. On the other hand the
very preponderance of Godwine's house sharpened the
antagonism of its rivals. When Harold, at length king in
name as well as in fact, had to face the two-fold danger of
invasion from Norway and from Normandy, he found those
parts of England which were not ruled by himself or his
brothers lukewarm in the national cause: the old separate
traditions, the old race jealousy of Angle, Saxon, Dane,
had resumed serious activity. The only solid support
he had was the finest body of trained infantry which the
world had seen since the decay of the Roman legion.</p>

<p>On January 5, 1066, Edward the Confessor died: his last
public act had been the consecration of his new abbey at
Westminster. The Witenagemot, assembled as usual at
Christmas time, and probably in unusual numbers for the
sake of the ceremony so dear to the heart of Edward, whose
end was known to be near, felt that no time must be lost
in filling the throne. The right of election beyond all
possible question lay with the Witan: custom prescribed the
choice of a member of the royal house, and gave obvious
and natural preference to the last king's son, at any rate if
he were a grown man; but not even he could have any right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>save by election and coronation. Now however the royal
house was extinct, save a feeble boy, grandson of Edward's
elder half-brother; William duke of Normandy was known
to be dreaming of the English crown. Under such circumstances
there was virtually no alternative but to elect some
one not of royal birth: and Harold the earl of Wessex, the
virtual ruler of England for some years past, was the only
possible choice. Accordingly the crown was offered to him
on the very day of Edward's death, and the next day saw
the burial of the dead saint and the coronation of the living
hero. Harold's position was a difficult one even at home,
besides the danger from over seas. The earldom of Mercia,
the whole centre of England, was ruled by Edwin, third in
succession of a family which had been permanently hostile
to the house of Godwine. Northumbria was in the hands of
his younger brother Morcar, who had replaced Harold's
brother Tostig, against whose tyrannous rule the men of
Northumbria had revolted. The young earls were in every
way contemptible, feeble in action, narrow-minded, selfish,
short-sighted. They saw no reason why Harold should be
preferred to themselves, and in their hatred of him lost sight
of their own true interests. They dallied with the thought
that England might once more be divided into separate
kingdoms for their benefit, being ignorant or reckless
enough to imagine that they would be able to withstand the
Norman if he, through their inactivity, succeeded in conquering
Wessex. For the time Harold's personal influence
won over the Northumbrians, and the two earls acquiesced in
his rule, and were only too glad of his assistance against
the Northmen: but when the final stress came not a man
whom Edwin and Morcar could control was found by the
king's side.</p>

<p>William the Norman had absolutely no claim to the crown
of England: his ambition saw an opportunity, and his
unscrupulous skill made a string of baseless pretexts look
sufficiently plausible to be accepted by those who wished to
believe in them. He said that he was the nearest of kin to
the late king, which was false; he was a distant cousin, but
only through Edward's Norman mother, and so was in no
way descended from the English royal house. As reasonably
might the king of France have claimed the crown of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>the Stuarts, on the ground that the wife of Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> was a
French princess. He said that Edward the Confessor had
promised him the succession; and it is most probable that
Edward, whose education had been Norman and whose
sympathies were not English, had encouraged him, years
before, to hope for it. But the king of England had no
right to bequeath the crown; and whatever influence a
dying king's recommendation might have, had been exerted
in favour of Harold. He said that Harold had done him
homage, and sworn<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> solemnly to recognise him as king
after Edward's death; but nothing that Harold might have
done could bind England. The crown of England was
elective, freely so in form: and the only limitation which
custom imposed, or which could be pretended to have legal
force, confined the choice to members of a single family to
which William did not belong.</p>

<p>Nevertheless William succeeded in making this farrago of
insolent irrelevancy deceive those whom he was interested
in persuading, by the aid of a policy even more unscrupulous
and far-reaching than his own. In the eleventh century
clearness of thought was rare; men were capable of grasping
the idea of kindred, without understanding that not every
form of kindred could give rights of inheritance. No one
in England, except the handful of Norman settlers, would
listen for a moment to William's pretensions: but in Europe
generally the notions of hereditary right, and of the sacredness
of royal blood, had gained a firmer hold, though
fortunately for William they were still vague. It seemed as
if a duke of Normandy must needs have a better claim to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>vacant throne than any mere subject. Most important of
all, William obtained the aid of the Church to condemn
Harold for perjury. England had always been too independent
to please the papacy; and Hildebrand, afterwards
the greatest of popes as Gregory <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr>, who already swayed
the papal policy, saw the value of the opportunity. To
denounce Harold as having forfeited the crown by his
perjury, to grant the solemn blessing of the Church to
William's mission of pure conquest, would, if William
succeeded, be a great step towards establishing the papal
claim to make and unmake kings at will, to be supreme
temporally as well as spiritually. William could thus appeal
for aid to the superstition as well as to the cupidity of all
the adventurers of western Europe, as the popes did later
for the crusades. It was indeed the first, the most successful,
and perhaps the most wicked of all crusades.</p>

<p>William lost no time in solemnly demanding the crown of
England as his by right, and formally calling on Harold to
fulfil his oath; of course he expected the curt refusal which
he received. It was no part of his policy to conceal his
purpose: rather he hoped to awaken superstitious terrors
in the minds of the English, and give them time to grow.
His preparations however took many months, and when he
was ready, contrary winds delayed the passage of the
Channel for many weeks more, to his great advantage.
Harold got together a large fleet to guard the Channel, and
called out the <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">fyrd</i> of the southern counties to defend the
coast. But a body of men serving without pay is hard to
keep together, and the imperfect resources of the age made
it difficult to feed them. In September, when the summer
was over, and no Norman expedition had appeared, Harold
was obliged to disband his army, and let the fleet go back
to London. Almost immediately he received the news
that another and to all appearance more formidable enemy
was on the point of invading England in the north.</p>

<p>Tostig, Harold's brother, who had been driven out by
his Northumbrian subjects, and whom Harold's justice had
refused to support against them, thought he saw his opportunity
for revenge and restoration. Whether he suggested
to Harold Hardrada, king of Norway, that he should
attempt to seize the English throne, or whether Hardrada
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>had already thought of it as a fitting crown to his career of
warlike adventure, is not clear. Certainly they united in
the last, the greatest and the most disastrous of the Viking
expeditions. With a fleet of several hundred ships, manned
it is said by half the fighting population of his kingdom,
Harold Hardrada crossed to the Orkneys, and drawing contingents
from thence and from Scotland, sailed down the
Northumbrian coast, plundering and destroying. Entering
the Humber, he went up the Ouse as far as Riccall, some
ten miles south of York, and leaving his ships there under
a guard, marched upon York. Morcar the earl of Northumbria
had so far made no attempt at resistance, but he
had gathered the <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">fyrd</i> of his earldom, and perhaps of
his brother's also, for the two earls moved together from
York to meet the invaders. On September 20 a battle
took place at Fulford, only two miles from York, in which
the earls, after a severe struggle, were decisively defeated.
The city surrendered, and the Northmen withdrew to
Stamford Bridge on the Derwent, eight miles east of York,
to await the collecting of hostages in token of the submission
of the whole earldom. King Harold, on hearing the news
of his namesake's expedition, had hastily gathered what
forces he could, and marched with all speed northwards.
On the morning of September 25 he reached York, which
had only surrendered the day before, and without halting
went in search of the enemy.</p>

<p>Harold Hardrada's camp was pitched on the eastern side
of the Derwent&mdash;the locality is still known as the Battle
Flats&mdash;but some of his men were on the western bank, keeping
no watch, and in no way prepared for battle. The road
from York rises slightly most of the way, and then descends
a mile or two to the Derwent: hence Harold's approach
was not seen until he was near at hand. The Northmen on
the western bank resisted as long as they could, but were
driven over the river. One man, we are told by his enemies,
defended the bridge with his single arm for some time,
until he was killed by a thrust from below. Then the
English crossed the Derwent, and the real struggle began.</p>

<p>The Northmen were drawn up, according to their usual
tactics when standing on the defensive, in a continuous ring,
their shields interlocking. In the centre rose their standard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>the black raven, significantly known as the Landwaster, the
gigantic form of the last of the Vikings towering beside it.
Their weapon of offence was the long two-handed sword,
though how they managed to wield it, and yet maintain the
continuity of the shield wall, is rather difficult to understand.</p>

<p>According to the famous saga of Snorro Sturleson, the
English king made one last effort for peace before beginning
the final onset. His face concealed by his helmet, he
rode across with a few of his thegns to the enemy, and
offered his brother forgiveness and the restoration of his
earldom if he would return to his allegiance. "And what,"
replied Tostig, "shall be given to king Harold of Norway?"
"Seven feet of land for a grave, or as much more
as he needs, since he is taller than other men." "Then go
back, and tell king Harold of England to prepare for
battle: it shall never be said in Norway that I brought their
king over to England, and then deserted him." The story
is too true to the spirit of the age not to be told; but
authority for it there is none, any more than for the words
of the champions in Homer. The saga was written so long
after the event that it had been quite forgotten how the
English of that day fought: they are described as consisting
entirely of horsemen and archers, after the fashion prevalent
two centuries and more later. Nothing on the contrary is
more certain than that at Stamford Bridge there were few or
none of either arm. The battle was fought and won mainly
by king Harold's housecarls, armed with the Danish axe.</p>

<p>It needs little imagination to picture the encounter of the
two hosts, clad and armed substantially in the same fashion,
practically of the same race. After a desperate hand-to-hand
conflict the English prevailed; Harold Hardrada and
Tostig were both killed, and the host of the Northmen was
almost annihilated. With politic mercy Harold allowed his
namesake's youthful son and the remnant of the invaders to
sail home, on their giving pledges for peace, which in truth
they were long in no condition to break. The victory of
Stamford Bridge was a great stroke for the security of
Europe generally: it broke for ever the aggressive power of
the Northmen, which for two centuries had been a standing
danger to all coasts from the mouth of the Baltic to far into
the Mediterranean, and which had completely conquered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>two regions as far remote from each other as Sicily and
Normandy. At the same time the fearful losses of the
battle may well have turned the scale in the struggle that was
impending with the transformed Northmen from across the
Channel.</p>

<p>William of Normandy's fleet and army was assembled in
the first instance at the mouth of the Dive, west of the Seine.
Of its numbers it is impossible to speak with confidence,
the accounts vary so greatly; but it was as large and complete
as the resources of his duchy and the promises he held
out to adventurers could make it. He was ready to sail
some time in August, but the wind was steadily contrary.
About the time when the English fleet was perforce withdrawn
from the Channel, he was able to move his whole
expedition to the mouth of the Somme, a necessary preliminary
to attempting to cross the Channel. So large a
fleet, consisting no doubt to a great extent of open boats,
could not possibly have ventured to make the passage from
the original point of assembly, which was doubtless selected
as being more central to Normandy generally. Not for two
or three weeks more did the necessary south wind blow.
On September 27 the wind was at last favourable: next
day William landed at Pevensey, and on the 29th occupied
Hastings, where he formed a fortified camp to protect his
ships. Nothing could have been more opportune for his
interests: he had been unable to move while the English
fleet was at sea, nor until Harold, far away in the north, had
been weakened by the slaughter among his housecarls at
Stamford Bridge. It was not the Norman's policy to plunge
into a hostile country. Harold must needs come to meet
him, and the nearer he could bring on a battle to his fleet,
and therefore to his means of escape in case of defeat, the
better for him. Accordingly he remained at Hastings,
ravaging the country far and wide, partly for subsistence,
partly to compel Harold to approach him.</p>

<p>A Sussex thegn soon brought the news to Harold: he
had ridden the whole distance to York in three days, and
found the king, so the story is told, at the banquet held in
honour of his recent victory. Harold returned to London
at once with his housecarls, summoning in all haste the
forces of the south and east of England, which responded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>heartily to the call, the men of Kent and of London foremost.
As soon as an adequate number was assembled, he
marched straight to meet the invader. The king's exact
movements cannot be traced, but the speed with which the
whole was accomplished was extraordinary. In sixteen
days at the latest from the time of William's landing,
Harold and his army were close to him. In that time the
news had been conveyed to York, the king's army had
marched the whole way back, and men had been sent for
and gathered from every shire from the Wash to the Exe.
While in London, say the chroniclers, Harold was urged to
let his brother Gyrth lead the army against the Norman, on
the ground that, while he could not deny his promise to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>William, and there was a widespread fear of the wrath of
the saints at his breaking the oath sworn on their relics, all
this applied only to Harold personally. The king might
stay in London, organise further levies, and by wasting the
country render the advance of the invaders impossible: all
would not be lost even if Gyrth were defeated. Harold
rejected the well-meant advice; he would ask no one to
run a risk he was not prepared to share, he would never
harm those who were entrusted to his care. The decision
was wise as well as chivalrous, in his peculiar position: his
standing aloof would only have strengthened the superstitious
awe which the maledictions of the Church on his
perjury aroused, and given excuse for other defections
than those for which Edwin and Morcar were responsible.
Under ordinary circumstances a king's or a commander-in-chief's
obvious duty is not to risk his own life. In Harold's
case every consideration dictated his being personally foremost
in the fight. It would have been well for England
had he acted on the advice in a reversed sense, and left
Gyrth behind in his stead. While Harold lived Gyrth was
only of minor importance; when Harold had fallen, the
cause of England might still have been sustained successfully
by his brother.</p>

</div>

<p>The contemporary, or nearly contemporary, accounts of
the battle of Hastings are numerous, both English and
Norman, but their statements differ greatly. Hardly any
of them write with knowledge of the ground; none, it may
be safely said, with anything like military precision. It is
easy to discount the exaggerations of partisanship; it is
easy to perceive that some statements made cannot be true,
for reasons of time and distance, or because they are based
on misapprehension of known facts. Beyond this one can
only conjecture, as one statement seems more probable
than another, or more easily reconcilable with things ascertained
beyond reasonable doubt. Moreover, though the
locality of the battle is open to no question, the appearance
of it has been so much changed, that reconstruction of its
condition at the date of the battle must again be imperfect.
Much was probably altered in the building of Battle Abbey,
much has certainly been altered in forming the grounds of
the modern house, which include the ruins of the abbey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>church. For instance the slope up to the spot where
Harold's standard was planted, a spot fixed for all time by
the high altar of Battle Abbey being placed there, is in its
upper part scarped to form a terrace. Again, the whole
position looks very like one that might have been selected
in earlier days for a camp. The ditch which some accounts
say covered Harold's front may possibly have been an
ancient one; in which case the hollow bearing the name
of Malfosse on the other side, where the defeated English
turned and smote their pursuers, may have been partly
artificial also. But the present state of the ground affords
no positive support to this conjecture, though it does not
negative it. All that can be done, in attempting to picture
the battle for modern readers, without going into wearisome
detail, is to tell the story in a form that does not contradict
the known conditions, and to refer to the original
authorities<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> readers who desire to judge for themselves.</p>

<p>Harold was by the necessity of the case compelled to
fight a battle: so far the Norman had prevailed. Tactically
however Harold succeeded in forcing the Norman to fight
on ground of his choosing, under conditions favourable to
the English method of fighting, and unfavourable to the
Norman method. He posted his army on a projecting bit
of hill, a spur in fact of the South Downs, close to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>direct road from Hastings towards London. William of
Normandy could not possibly pass the English without
fighting: if he did so he was liable to be cut off from his
ships. Nor could he wait indefinitely at Hastings: he had
no choice but to advance. Further, to receive attack in a
defensive position was what gave the best chance of success
to the English, practically all foot-soldiers, the best of them
clothed in mail shirts and armed with axes. Finally, the
piece of ground actually chosen was exactly suitable for its
purpose: it was not too large to be fully manned, and it
compelled the Normans to charge uphill. On the other
hand it is obvious that the Normans, whose main strength
lay in mailed horsemen, could not stand on the defensive;
attack was what they were fitted for.</p>

<p>Harold's army was drawn up facing to the south, on a
ridge somewhat under a mile in length. The ground in
front sloped away, gently on the right, steeply in the centre,
rather less steeply on the left flank, where the little town of
Battle now stands. Behind the right and again behind the
left there were hollows, the latter being apparently then the
most marked. Behind the centre of the hill was a sort of
broad isthmus connecting it with the mass of the Downs.
Along the whole or part of the front a palisade<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of some
kind seems to have been constructed, by way of protection
against the onset of the Norman horsemen: but this cannot
possibly have been an elaborate and solid barrier. In the
first place there was not time to make such a thing; as has
been already noted, the interval between William's landing
and the battle was amazingly short for what was done in it.
Harold cannot possibly have had more than one October
day in which to fortify his position. Nor is there the least
probability that the Norman would have looked on, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>the position he would have to attack was strengthened to
the extent suggested. Moreover there were no materials
for such a work ready to hand, though there may well have
been plenty for a slighter fence. A chronicler of later date
does indeed say that houses were pulled down for the
purpose; but the contemporaries imply, if they do not
positively assert, that there were none near: the spot is
identified in one English chronicle only as being "by the
hoary apple-tree." Again, the narratives of the actual
battle describe close hand-to-hand fighting, which must
have been across the barrier, if there was one; and this is
obviously inconsistent with its having been a massive structure,
still more so with its having been double or triple.
Whatever the nature of the fortification, whether palisade or
ditch, or both, it was only a slight additional protection:
the real defence of the position was the stout arms of the
English.</p>

<p>The Norman camp was still at Hastings, seven miles off.
We hear of spies being sent out by both sides, and of
the Englishmen, unused to see shaven faces, coming back
with the report that there were more priests than soldiers
among the Normans. We hear of formal demands made
by William that Harold should keep his oath, or submit to
the arbitration of the Church, an obvious mockery, as the
Pope had already sent William a consecrated banner in
token of his solemn blessing on the invasion. We even
hear of William challenging Harold to decide the dispute
by single combat. Such are just the details likely to be
invented by a narrator desiring to be picturesque; the only
intrinsic improbability about them is that they imply a longer
time spent by the two armies in the presence of each other
than is consistent with the known facts.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of October 14, the Norman host
marched out from Hastings, and passing over the intervening
high ground, halted on the hill of Telham, whence they
looked down on the English position, a mile and a half
away on the other side of the valley. Here the knights
assumed their heavy armour, and the duke by accident put
on his coat of mail hind part before. His superstitious
followers were shocked at the evil omen, but he readily
turned it, as most such supposed presages can be turned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>in his own favour, saying, "That means that my duchy will
be turned into a kingdom." Hearing from one of his spies
that Harold's standard was displayed, so that there was no
doubt that the king was there and meant to fight, William
went on to vow that in case of victory he would build an
abbey where that standard stood. The centre of the army,
when drawn up for attack, consisted of the native Normans,
the left of the auxiliaries from Brittany and Maine, more
or less dependent on Normandy; the right was formed of
the French adventurers who had joined in the expedition
in hopes of sharing the plunder of England, but was commanded
by William Fitzosborn and Roger of Montgomery,
two of William's most trusted nobles. The sole idea of
battle being an attack straight to the front, the whole line
was formed in the same way. The archers went foremost
to do what mischief they could to the stationary English.
Next came the heavier armed foot-soldiers to break down
the defences (whatever they were), and open the way for
the mounted knights, who constituted the third line, and
on whom the chief stress of decisive fighting would fall.
In the centre rode the duke himself, with his brother Odo
bishop of Bayeux by his side, each armed, as the tapestry
shows them, with the heavy mace.</p>

<p>It was about nine a.m.,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> according to the chroniclers who
note the hour, that the battle began. About the centre of
the English line were planted the twin royal standards.
The red dragon of Wessex, which had waved over many a
battle-field and had but rarely seen defeat, appeared now
for the last time. Beside it Harold's own personal device,
the Fighting-man, the figure of an armed warrior embroidered
in gold, marked on its first and last field the spot where the
king and his brothers fought. Harold's housecarls, and the
men of London and Kent armed in like fashion, formed the
centre of the line. On their left were seemingly men less
heavily armed, but quite able to hold their own against
their opponents. On this part of the line the fighting
throughout the battle seems to have been obstinate, equal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>and uneventful; the great oscillations of fortune, the
murderous repulses, the ultimate success of the Normans,
are at the centre and on the right. From the present
appearance of the ground there can be no doubt that the
access to the English right was by a much gentler slope
than elsewhere. Nevertheless the ill-armed portion of the
English host, peasants with no defensive armour, carrying
javelins or clubs, a few possibly with bows, were there
placed. A modern general would certainly have guarded
with special care the flank that was most easily assailable.
Harold doubtless took for granted, and quite correctly, that
wherever he planted his standard, thither the principal
attack would be directed.</p>

<p>While the archers covered the general advance with a
flight of arrows, a minstrel named Taillefer rode forward
singing "of Charlemagne and Roland, and those who died
at Roncesvalles." Throwing his sword into the air and
catching it again, he made straight for the English, and
killed two, one with his lance and one with his sword,
before he himself fell. Behind him the Norman foot-soldiers
charged up the hill, met by darts and stones, and
as they reached the line by the deadlier hand weapons.
Finding that they made no impression, William led in
person the charge of the mailed knights, to be equally
repulsed. Horse and man went down under the blows of
the terrible axe. The Bretons and others on the Norman
left fled in confusion, pursued by some of the English right,
who contrary to orders broke their ranks to follow up the
flying enemy. Panic and disorder spread more or less to
the centre: there was a cry that the duke was slain: the
battle was almost lost. Baring his head, William in person
stemmed the tide and drove the fugitives back: they rallied
and cut down such of the English as had ventured far in
pursuit.</p>

<p>The duke, as soon as order was restored, led a fresh
attack on the English standard. This time his horse was
killed under him, but he himself escaped unhurt, to deal
with his own hand, if one is to follow Professor Freeman's
account, a very serious blow to the English cause, by slaying
Gyrth, Harold's brother and most trusted counsellor.
Harold's other brother Leofwine fell, according to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>picture in the Tapestry, about the same time with Gyrth.
Still the English line remained unbroken; though the
defences must have been by this time more or less broken
down, the men behind were as firm as ever. Had not
William possessed a ready insight, prompter than anything
we find elsewhere in medi√¶val warfare, the Norman
chivalry would have exhausted itself finally in vain charges,
and Hastings had been as Crecy. The Norman duke
however had noted that the only thing which hitherto had
disturbed the impregnable line of the English was the rush
from the right in pursuit of the flying Bretons. He ventured
on the bold experiment of bidding his left make a fresh
assault, take again to flight, and if the English rushed
forward, turn suddenly on the pursuers. The stratagem
succeeded; again the English, out of reach of their king's
direct authority, broke their line entirely. When the
feigned flight was converted into a fresh charge they were
taken utterly at a disadvantage, and though they filled the
hollow round the right of the position with French dead,
they none the less were routed. The Norman horsemen
could now easily reach the level of the hill top, and charge
along it towards the standard, instead of toiling up the
slope in front. Even yet the battle was in doubt; the
Normans could bring the weight of horses and men to bear
more effectually, and the English had lost the protection
such as it was of their palisade, but the horsemen could
charge only on a narrow front, the width of the ridge,
instead of up its whole face. Once more William's ready
skill suggested a combination against which mere courage
and strength must ultimately fail. His archers had obviously
been useless while the direct charges up the slope were
going on, and of little avail in the intervals, when the
English could protect themselves with their shields. He
could now use both archers and horsemen together, for the
ground to the south was free<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> for the archers, when the
knights had reached the hill top on their left. Bidding his
archers shoot into the air, so that their arrows fell like rain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>about the standard, he led the horsemen on once more.
The device was fatal. The English could not ward off the
arrows, while engaged in hand-to-hand conflict: they must
perish or give way, unless darkness came to their rescue.
Just before sunset the final blow was struck: an arrow
pierced Harold's eye, and as he lay in agony at the foot of
the standard he was despatched by four knights. If we
could believe the exulting French poet they mangled his
body brutally; but this is happily inconsistent with the
certain fact that his corpse was found and buried. The
standards were trampled down, the position was at every
part seized by the Normans; still the desperate English
fought on, and hardly a man of Harold's personal following,
or of the nobility of southern England, survived the day,
except those already too badly wounded to move. Under
cover of the darkness the light armed English fled, again
inflicting serious loss on their pursuers, who rolled headlong
into the hollow that afterwards bore the significant name of
Malfosse.</p>

<p>Had Harold, or even Gyrth, survived the battle, the
conquest of England, it is said, need not have ensued.
The remark is a futile one; under the peculiar conditions
there was no third alternative. Harold, we may safely say,
never dreamed of the possibility of surviving defeat: and
his brothers, once in the field, would share his fate, whether
victory or death. The Norman duke, we are told, to taste
the full flavour of his triumph, had his tent pitched where
the English standard had stood, and passed the night there,
surrounded by the piled-up dead. Next day William superintended
the burial of his own dead; the corpses of the
English he left to the dogs and birds, except such as their
kindred carried away. Two monks from Harold's own
abbey of Waltham came offering large sums, in their own
name and in the name of his aged mother, for leave to inter
the fallen king within the walls he had built. But the conqueror
was inexorable: he bade one of his knights bury the
body of the accursed of the Church beneath a cairn of stones
on the Sussex shore.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Little as William meant it, he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>giving the noblest of sepulchres to the fallen hero, the one
English king who has died fighting for his fatherland.</p>

<p>Our sympathies are naturally with Harold and the English,
defending their homes and their independence against unprovoked
foreign aggression. William's claim was based on
falsehood, supported by fraud, established by violence.
Nevertheless when once king he ruled well and wisely. If
he rewarded his followers with English lands, he prevented
the intrusive nobles from obtaining the position and privileges
which would render them a mere curse to England.
In the fifth generation their descendants had become the
leaders of a fairly united nation, winning for all ranks and
classes the Great Charter of liberty. Without the Norman
Conquest, without the new blood mingled with the English
race, without the new ideas introduced into church and
state through closer intercourse with the continent, the
subsequent history must have been totally different, and so
far as conjecture is admissible, far less eminent than it in
fact has been, alike in arts and arms, in commerce and in
government.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the art of war, the battle of
Hastings is also important, marking an epoch there too
very decidedly. For more than two centuries after Hastings
infantry are of no account in western Europe. The battle
had indeed been won by the skilful combination of archery
with the charge of mailed horsemen. It is at least doubtful
whether the latter would finally have prevailed without the
rain of arrows to smite and perplex those whom they were
attacking in front. The horsemen however did in fact
trample under foot the last relics of Harold's heavy armed
foot-soldiers, and feudal pride did the rest. It was taken
for granted on all hands that mailed knights, and they alone,
constituted strength in war, and this fell in with the political
ideas of the age only too well. Seven generations were
destined to elapse before the tables began to be turned on
the knights.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE BARONS' WAR</small></h2>


<p>The Norman Conquest was, to the English body politic,
like one of those powerful drugs which seriously disorder
the constitution for the time, but if the patient has strength
to bear the treatment do him permanent good. The
Barons' War was, as it were, the last feverish fit resulting
from the Conquest. The Normans, though they had
adopted French ideas and speech, were in race closely
akin to the Anglo-Danes; and the fusion between them was
hastened by the accession of the house of Anjou to the
throne. The Conqueror and his sons had to a certain
extent identified themselves with England, leaning for support
against the turbulent Norman barons upon their English
subjects. Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, though he did great things for England
as a wise legislator and strong administrator, was
distinctly a foreigner. His father was French, his wife was
French, his ambition was to dominate France. Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>,
without his grandfather's strong qualities for both good
and evil, was still more completely un-English. His confidence
was given only to foreigners, to the Poitevin kindred
of his mother, to the Proven√ßal and Savoyard kindred of
his wife, never to Englishmen. He fleeced the nation and
the church beyond endurance to enrich foreign favourites,
to satisfy the Pope, to further schemes of vague ambition
alien, if not hostile, to English interests. Naturally strong
opposition was roused, which pervaded the nation generally,
and was headed by the greatest of the nobles and the most
conspicuous prelates who were not foreign intruders. Their
chief, Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester, though French
by birth, had inherited a great station from his English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>mother, and was as thorough an English patriot as was in
that age possible. The barons at length forced upon the
king changes in his government, which amounted to a
temporary superseding of the royal authority. The king of
course strove to free himself from restraint: and desultory
hostilities followed, which led to an agreement to refer the
matters in dispute to the arbitration of the king of France.
The high reputation of Saint Louis seems to have blinded
the barons to the fact that he was on principle a steady
upholder of royal power. His award was completely in
Henry's favour, and the appeal was most injurious to the
barons' cause. They must either abandon all that they had
been contending for, or repudiate the judgment they had
themselves accepted beforehand. The former evil was the
worse of the two: they chose war.</p>

<p>The decisive struggle took place at Lewes in Sussex,
which the king had made his headquarters, as being the
seat of earl Warrenne, his brother-in-law and most powerful
supporter. Montfort marched to Fletching, some nine
miles from Lewes, whence he despatched the bishops of
London and Worcester to attempt to come to terms with
the king. The royalist party were far too confident to listen
to any compromise; probably they were ignorant of Montfort's
strength, for they did not even send out scouts to
watch his movements. On receiving the contemptuous
defiance of the king the barons resolved to march before
daylight next morning (May 14, 1264). Religious feeling
ran high in their camp: earl Simon exhorted all his followers
to confess their sins before the battle, and the bishop
of Worcester solemnly absolved and blessed the kneeling
host, after which all put a white cross on breast and back,
as a token that they were going to war for the right. The
army advanced unopposed and unobserved, till they came
up on the great ridge of the South Downs, whence they
could see Lewes, about two miles off. Here a halt was
made, to form order of battle, before beginning the descent.
The Londoners, a numerous body and zealous in the cause,
but little trained to war, were on the left. Montfort's sons
commanded the right, the earl of Gloucester the centre.
Montfort himself was at the head of a fourth division, which
was either in reserve, or on the right centre. Modern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>writers seem agreed that it was in reserve, though the contemporary
authorities do not say so expressly: apparently
they assume it, because the regular medi√¶val practice was
to divide into three "battles."<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> If Montfort really did so
organise his line of battle, he was in advance of his contemporaries,
and most thoroughly deserved his victory.
The earl is credited with a rather puerile device by way of
deceiving the enemy. He had injured his leg some time
before, and had been obliged to travel in some kind of
carriage,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> or horse litter. This had accompanied him so
far: he now left it behind on the ridge of the downs, with
the baggage of the army, under a guard; and it is suggested
that he did this in order to make the royalists think he had
stayed there in person, unable to ride.</p>

<p>The barons' army was approaching Lewes from the
north-west. The tidal river Ouse half encircles the town;
coming from the north it bends round the east side, where
the bridge was and is, and then flows southwards to the sea,
but at that date the ground to the south of the town was
more or less flooded every tide. On the north edge of
the town is the castle, on the south the large priory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Pancras, which was the king's headquarters. From the
height where Montfort left his baggage a well-marked ridge
runs southwards, falling almost to the level of the plain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>two miles due west of Lewes. South of this the ground
again rises in a sort of hog's back on which stand two wind-mills,
bearing the name of Kingstone mills: the present
Brighton road runs through the gap. East of the ridge is a
hollow, large enough to hold the present race-course, and
beyond this is a gentler slope, straight down to Lewes, which
is hollowed out in its lower part, so as to divide it into two,
the easternmost portion leading straight to the castle.</p>

<p>On the alarm being given the royalist army assembled in
all haste, in the usual three divisions, of which prince Edward,
the king's eldest son, commanded the right; the king in
person was in the centre; the left was under his brother
Richard, earl of Cornwall, the titular king of the Romans.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
The prince, issuing from the castle, found himself opposed
to the Londoners who formed Montfort's left wing, and who
seem to have been somewhat in advance. With youthful
zeal he charged them at once, and put them to flight.
Some writers say that he selected the Londoners for attack,
because of his eagerness to avenge the insults offered to his
mother in passing through London a little while before: and
it is perfectly possible that this animosity led him to pursue
them, as in fact he did, several miles, thereby losing the
battle: but it is obvious that he had no time to select his
opponents, even if the arrangement which committed the
right wing to his leadership had allowed it. Gloucester
with the centre came down the other part of the slope leading
straight to the town, and thus encountered the king: of
this there can be no reasonable doubt, or that the king
after an obstinate conflict was driven into the priory. But
it seems to be generally assumed that Henry and Guy
de Montfort led their wing down the ridge which runs
southwards, and that Richard of Cornwall met them at
the bottom. The slope is extremely steep for a medi√¶val
force of mounted horsemen in order of battle; moreover to
do this would have left a very dangerous gap between the
right and centre. It seems more probable that Montfort's
right descended straight on Lewes in close proximity to the
centre. However this may be, the right wing encountered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>the earl of Cornwall's troops, and could make no impression
on them, until Montfort supported his sons with his own
division. Then the king of the Romans was routed, and
himself took refuge in a wind-mill, doubtless on the spot
now known as Kingstone,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> where he eventually surrendered.
By this time the king's own division had also been
broken, and though part escaped into the priory, most part
of them were cut off from both it and the castle, and were
slaughtered in the streets of the town. The only hope of
retrieving even partially the fortunes of the day lay in the
prince, who after pursuing the Londoners to his heart's
content, had caught sight on his return of Montfort's
carriage, and assuming that the earl was lying helpless in it,
made a dash to seize him and the baggage. The carriage
however contained three citizens of London who had
entered into some plot against Montfort, and had been
carried off as prisoners and left there for safety; but in the
confusion of the sudden onslaught the poor citizens were
killed by their own friends. By the time prince Edward had
got back to Lewes it was growing dark; many of his companions,
including earl Warrenne himself, seeing that all was
lost, fled over the bridge, which soon became a scene of
frightful confusion, hundreds being drowned in the river, or
forced into the tidal mud and there suffocated.</p>

<p>The foregoing account of the battle of Lewes is partly
conjectural: the chroniclers are as usual wanting in precision
of language, and not altogether in accord; and there is
always room for doubt as to the identification of localities
vaguely described. It agrees with the conformation of the
ground, and with the ascertained facts: particularly it explains
the king being driven into the priory, and the earl of
Cornwall into a wind-mill. With the royal right wing gone,
after the prince had dashed on the Londoners, Gloucester
would have had no real difficulty in pressing the king's
right, so as to cut him off from the castle, which would
be an obvious advantage. Again Montfort's own troops,
whether in the right centre or in the second line, would
naturally have come down on Richard of Cornwall's right,
and separated him from the king, and unless the story of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>Richard's barricading himself in a wind-mill is altogether
an invention, which there is not the slightest reason to
imagine, it could only have been the Kingstone mill.
Wind-mills, beyond most things, remain for centuries on
the same spot.</p>

<p>The Barons' War is the only occasion in English history,
except the great civil war of the seventeenth century, in
which a national party in arms against the crown won a
great victory in the field, and became dominant in consequence,
at least temporarily. It is an interesting coincidence
that the blunder which lost Lewes, the eagerness of a youthful
prince to pursue his routed opponents, regardless of the
general fate of the battle, should have been repeated, not
once only, by his descendant four centuries later. The
hastiness of Rupert prevented Edgehill from being a victory,
and definitely lost Naseby, the final battle of the war.
Otherwise Lewes has no great military interest. It exhibits
the disastrous results to a defeated army of having a river
in its rear, and (possibly) the value of a reserve. But the
two armies were alike in equipment, in straightforward hard
fighting all along the line, in the preponderance of mailed
horsemen. Of missile weapons we hear nothing, except
that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">balistarii</i> assisted in defeating Richard of Cornwall:
the word is often used to denote cross-bowmen, and probably
has that meaning here. The strange thing is that there
should be no trace of the archers, who only thirty years later
played an important part at Falkirk.</p>

<p>The battle of Lewes made Montfort master of England,
and gave him the opportunity of summoning the famous
assembly, to which for the first time the towns sent representatives.
His rule was not very successful: hampered as
he was by the natural hostility of the king and his adherents,
and by the selfish jealousy of some of his own party, he
would have been more than human if he had overcome all
his difficulties, and laid himself open to no imputations of
personal love of power. The fact that he had the king in
his hands, virtually a prisoner, made his position especially
difficult. So long as the king was in his power, he could
not expect the royalists to acquiesce in his new policy: to
let him go was to give up his one safeguard. The earl of
Gloucester, the most powerful of his supporters, broke away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>from him, chiefly out of personal jealousy. Earl Warrenne
and others of the fugitives from Lewes landed in South
Wales with a strong force in the spring of 1265. Montfort
was at Hereford, trying to quiet the disordered marches of
Wales, the king and prince Edward with him. From
Hereford the prince made his escape on May 28, and
became naturally the head of the royalist party. Bristol,
Gloucester, Worcester fell into the hands of prince Edward;
the earl was unable to cross the Severn, and was obliged to
wait until his second son Simon could bring an army to his
assistance. Simon had been besieging Pevensey, and was a
long time in reaching Kenilworth, his father's principal stronghold.
The castle was too small to contain his troops, and
Simon with incredible carelessness allowed them to remain
outside without keeping any guard, apparently for two or three
days at least, since Edward at Worcester had time to hear of
it, it is said through a female spy. On the night of July 31,
Edward marched rapidly from Worcester, and completely
surprised young Simon's forces, capturing several important
prisoners and all the baggage. Simon himself escaped into
the castle, but he and his army were utterly lost to his
father's cause.</p>

<p>On the same day the earl of Leicester left Hereford, and
crossing the Severn in boats camped some miles to the south
of Worcester. He probably had heard that his son had
reached Kenilworth, and may either have purposed to
attack prince Edward, while, as he might expect, his son was
approaching the prince from another quarter, or simply to
effect a junction with his son. Edward had taken great
pains, apparently with success, to let no fugitives escape
from Kenilworth: for the earl never heard of his son's overthrow.
The exact times are somewhat differently given by
the various authorities, but it is quite certain that Montfort
was in Evesham early on August 4, and that Edward knew
of his movements and had time to anticipate him. One
story is that the king, who was still with him, insisted on
stopping at Evesham on the evening of the 3rd, that he
might sup in the abbey and hear mass there next morning,
a request with which the earl could not decently refuse to
comply without a strong motive, which, ignorant as he was
of the disaster at Kenilworth, he could not have. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>king's love of ease, and of devotion, would account for this
well enough: that he did it in concert with his son, in order
to delay Montfort, is not credible, for in that case Edward
might have saved some miles of a hard march. The prince,
on ascertaining that the earl had moved from his camp at
Kempsey south of Worcester, in the direction of Kenilworth,
formed a plan for cutting him off.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="i_b_035"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_035.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="Map III: Battle of Evesham." />
</div>

<p>Evesham stands on the north bank of the Avon, at the
bottom of a loop some two miles deep and one wide. In
the thirteenth century the banks were marshy, and there was
no bridge for a long distance, except one at Evesham leading
to the hamlet of Bengeworth on the east of the loop.
Over the high ground known as Green Hill, rising above
the town and filling the north part of the loop, ran the
direct road from Worcester, crossing the Avon by a ford<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>at Offenham, two miles above Evesham. By this road
prince Edward set part of his forces, including probably all
his foot-soldiers, to march in the night of August 3, in
pursuit of Leicester, entrusting the command to his new
supporter the earl of Gloucester. He himself started with
a large body of horsemen on the north road, so that his
purpose might not be detected, then cutting across country
to the eastward reached the ford on the Avon at Prior's
Cleeve, some miles above Evesham, early on the 4th. As
the road from Evesham to Kenilworth passes near Prior's
Cleeve on the left bank, he hoped thus to intercept the earl
in front, while Gloucester pressed on his rear. Finding
that there was no sign of Montfort's approach, he descended
the left bank as far as Offenham: thence he despatched
Roger Mortimer with a detachment to hold the bridge at
Bengeworth and prevent the earl escaping that way, and
himself recrossed the Avon and occupied Green Hill.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>When troops were first seen from Evesham on the slopes
above, it was supposed that they were young Montfort's
army come to join his father: for among the banners that
waved over the prince's ranks were those captured at Kenilworth.
"It is my son," said the old earl, "nevertheless
go up and look, lest we be deceived." The earl's barber,
Nicholas, ascended the bell-tower of the abbey, and soon
detected the banners of the prince and his supporters, and
presently saw Gloucester's forces come up the western side
of the hill from the road along the Avon. The earl went
up to see for himself, but he knew that he was ruined: the
only road of escape for his army must by this time have
been almost barred by Mortimer, and his men were not
even formed for march. Individuals might yet escape by
swimming the Avon, or dashing across the bridge before
Mortimer arrived, but for the main body the only way lay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>through the hostile army, outnumbering his by three or four
to one. "God have mercy on our souls," he exclaimed,
"for our bodies are the enemy's." The rest of the story
cannot be told better than in Professor Prothero's words.</p>

<p>"His friends urged him to fly, but the thought of flight
for himself was not in his mind. A natural flash of anger
burst forth in the remark that it was the folly of his own
son which had brought him to this pass. Nevertheless he
endeavoured to persuade his eldest son Henry, his old comrade
Hugh Despenser, and others to fly while there was yet
time, and maintain the good cause when fortune should smile
again. But one and all refused to desert him, preferring
not to live if their leader died. 'Come then,' he said, 'and
let us die like men; for we have fasted here and we shall
breakfast in heaven.' His troops were hastily shriven by
the aged bishop of Worcester, who had performed the same
office a year before upon a happier field. Then he led them
out against the enemy, with the white cross again upon their
shoulders, in as close order as he could. In the midst of
them was the king, for Simon seems to the last to have
cherished a faint hope of cutting his way through his adversaries;
and as at Lewes, the possession of the royal person
was everything to him. As they neared the hill, prince
Edward's troops, who had been in no hurry to leave their
point of vantage, began to descend upon them. Simon's
heart was struck with admiration of the fair array before
him, so different from that which he had met a year before;
his soldierly pride told him to whom their skill was due.
'By the arm of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James,' he cried, 'they come on well;
they learnt that not of themselves but of me.'</p>

<p>"On the south-western slope of Green Hill there is a
small valley or combe; in this hollow the chief struggle
raged. On the further side, in the grounds of a private
house, stands the obelisk, which marks the spot where,
according to tradition, Simon de Montfort fell. Towards
the higher part of the combe is a spring, still called
Montfort's Well, which, on the day of the battle, is said to
have run with blood. Prince Edward began the fray, and
while the earl was engaged with him, Gloucester came up
with a second body on his left, so that he was soon surrounded.
The Welsh infantry, poor, half-armed troops, fled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>at once, and were cut down in the neighbouring gardens by
Mortimer's forces, which must now have been advancing
from the rear. Simon's horse was killed under him; his
eldest son was among the first to fall. When this was told
him, he cried, 'Is it so? then indeed is it time for me to
die;' and rushing upon the enemy with redoubled fury, and
wielding his sword with both his hands, the old warrior laid
about him with so terrific force, that had there been but
half-a-dozen more like himself, says one who saw the fight,
he would have turned the tide of battle. As it was he
nearly gained the crest of the hill. But it was not to be.
For a while he stood 'like a tower,' but at length a foot-soldier,
lifting up his coat of mail, pierced him in the back,
and, with the words <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dieu merci</i> on his lips, he fell. Then
the battle became a butchery. No quarter was asked or
given. The struggle lasted for about two hours in the early
summer morning, and then all was over.</p>

<p>"Of the horrid cruelties practised by the victors on the
body of their greatest foe it is better not to speak. The
gallant old man lay, with the few who remained faithful to
him and to his cause, dead upon the field, and with him the
curtain seemed to fall upon all that was free and noble in
the land. The tempests which raged throughout the country
that day were remarked as shadowing forth the grief of
heaven. The accompanying darkness, which was so thick
that in some places the monks could no longer see to chant
their prayers, was nothing to that which must have fallen
on many when they heard of the death of their protector.
But he had not lived in vain. England had learnt a lesson
from him, and had seen glimpses of what might be; and a
retributive justice brought his principles to life again through
the very hands which had destroyed him."</p>

<p>It is a coincidence that Montfort, whose victory at Lewes
was made so complete by the royalists having the Ouse
behind them to cut off their flight, should have himself been
destroyed by being caught in the same trap. He did not
however wilfully commit the blunder of fighting with a river
at his back: his ruin was due to the overthrow which his
son had incurred by his own folly at Kenilworth, and to the
skill with which the prince utilised his very superior information.
Edward seems indeed to have developed in these few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>months from a headstrong boy into a general of exceptional
power for his age. At Lewes he threw away a fair chance
by his impetuosity, while Montfort, employing his inferior
numbers to the best advantage, was securing the victory
behind him. At Evesham he so used his opportunities that
the earl, who had given him that severe lesson, had no scope
for generalship: he could only fight and die as a brave man
should.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>FALKIRK AND BANNOCKBURN</small></h2>


<p>In 1290 Margaret of Norway, the infant queen of Scotland,
died, and a difficult question arose as to the succession
to her. Edward <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> of England had made it the chief object
of his policy to strengthen and consolidate his power within
the island. To this end he made Parliament a permanent
institution, truly representative of the nation as then constituted,
though it was not very willingly that he concurred in
limitations of his prerogative at the hands of Parliament,
which he had systematised, if not created. To this end was
directed much of the legislation which is his highest title to
fame. To this end he had conquered Wales, and taken the
first steps towards incorporating it with England. Now he
had an opportunity of uniting Scotland to his own kingdom
(he had made plans already for effecting this through a
marriage between his heir and the little Maid of Norway),
at any rate of making his influence paramount in Scotland.</p>

<p>National prejudices have very naturally coloured the
views of historical writers, especially on the Scottish side,
who have discussed the right and wrong of the conflict that
ultimately ensued. There is no need to enter deeply into the
controversy, but it is safe to say that neither party was entirely
in the wrong. The English kings had for centuries had
some kind of superiority over Scotland, but it dated back to
times when feudal theories had not been formulated; and
it is clear that Edward <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> claimed too much when he asserted
his right to be feudal suzerain over Scotland in the
widest sense. On the other hand the Scots could not
honestly maintain that he had no rights at all over it, as
being an independent kingdom. The question of the succession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
was a thorny one in every way. There was not,
and could not be, any written law on the subject: all the
claimants were remotely related to the royal house: all of
them whose claims could be seriously pressed, even in an
age when ideas on such matters were vague, were nobles of
Norman descent, having lands in England as well as in
Scotland. Edward on being called in to award the crown
required all concerned to acknowledge him as feudal overlord.
The competitors, already personally his subjects,
naturally made no objection, and if any was made by others,
their voice was drowned. Edward awarded the crown to
John Balliol, the person who had the best claim according
to the legal principles now fully recognised. Difficulties
soon arose: the new king's subjects appealed against him
to the king of England, which they had a right to do if the
king of Scotland was in the full sense vassal, but not otherwise.
Edward entertained the appeals, asserting to the very
utmost his feudal authority, till the patience of John Balliol
was overtaxed. Taking advantage of a quarrel between
England and France,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> John Balliol repudiated his allegiance
to Edward; the latter, caring infinitely more for
Scotland than for his dominions over sea, let things take
their chance in Guienne, and returned to make war on
Scotland. His success was easy and complete: Balliol was
declared to have forfeited his kingdom, which the lord
paramount took into his own hands. At first there was no
opposition; there existed in the country a considerable
amount of patriotic feeling, but there were no leaders, until
one suddenly appeared in William Wallace. Personal injuries
received from English soldiers led to his taking up
arms, but he was welcomed as a leader by such elements in
the Scottish people as cared for their independence, and he
justified their confidence. The English forces in Scotland
were but small, and Wallace had time to organise resistance
on a large scale before he was called on to face an invading
army.</p>

<p>A glance at the map<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> will show how completely Stirling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>is the military centre of Scotland. The firths of Forth and
Clyde indent the country very deeply on the east and west,
almost dividing it into two parts. Hence Stirling, the
lowest point where the Forth is bridged, and commanding
the entrances into Fife, into the basin of the Tay, and into
the western Highlands, is of primary importance. Here
Wallace defeated in 1297 the army first sent against him;
at Falkirk not far off he was defeated in the next year; at
Bannockburn, within sight of Stirling Castle, was fought
the great battle of 1314, which virtually achieved Scottish
independence.</p>

<p>Wallace was a born soldier, as he proved alike by his
easy victory of Cambuskenneth, and by his dispositions for
meeting king Edward's superior force at Falkirk. The
Forth flows through the plain, from above Stirling till it
opens into the estuary, in many loops and windings; there
was then but one narrow bridge across it, leading from close
to Stirling to the abbey of Cambuskenneth, which stands in
one of the loops on the eastern bank. When Wallace
learned that his enemies were approaching, he posted his
men on a bold steep hill known as the Abbey Craig, which
is in fact the extreme south-western spur of the Ochil hills.
The English leaders, ignorant of their business and despising
their opponents, began crossing the river to attack him.
Wallace waited till a considerable portion of the English
had crossed, and were crowded together in a loop of the
Forth, and then led his men down to attack. It was rather
a butchery than a battle: the English on the east of the
Forth, outnumbered, unable to take order, devoid of any
way of retreat, could make no effectual resistance. The
numbers given in the chronicles are probably excessive: it
is most unlikely that the earl of Surrey should have had
50,000, or Wallace 40,000 men: but under the conditions
it is obvious that Wallace could choose his time, so as to
have a decisive superiority to that portion of the enemy which
alone could encounter him. The slaughter of the defeated
side in a hand-to-hand battle was always great, and Cambuskenneth
was no exception. The earl of Surrey had never
crossed the fatal bridge; but among other Englishmen of
note who fell, was Cressingham, the king's treasurer for
Scotland, who was much hated for his exactions. "And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>so," says the chronicler, "he who had terrified many with
the sword of his tongue was himself slain with the sword:
and the Scots flayed him, and divided his skin into little
bits, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non quidem ad reliquias, sed ad contumelias</i>."</p>

<p>In consequence of this victory, Wallace was recognised as
guardian of the kingdom in the name of the fugitive John
Balliol, and governed Scotland with some success for the
time. Edward <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> fully understood the wisdom of doing
things thoroughly, and when he next year invaded Scotland,
came with an overwhelming army. It took him some time
to capture Berwick, and during the siege Wallace contrived
to leave Lothian bare of inhabitants and of food. His hope
was to baffle the invaders by preventing their finding
sustenance or guidance. Two Scottish nobles are said to
have sent word to Edward where his enemy was, but it is
hardly likely that this would have been so serious a difficulty
as the lack of food, which rendered abortive, at one time
or another, several invasions of Scotland on a large scale.
Obviously Wallace must fight at or near Stirling, if not
sooner, or else retire into the wild country of the north,
which meant giving up all the valuable parts of Scotland
to the English king. His numbers were far below those
of his enemy: his only chance lay in skilful arrangements
for defence. He selected a piece of sloping ground
near Falkirk, where a small stream, running at that part
through very soft and boggy ground, covered his front. The
mass of his soldiers were spearmen, and these he drew up
in four circular masses, the front rank sitting, with their
spear-butts resting on the ground. The intermediate spaces
were occupied by the archers, who were neither efficient nor
very numerous; and the mounted men-at-arms, very few
in comparison with the English array, were drawn up in
rear. One chronicler adds that Wallace addressed to his
men the somewhat grim jest, "I have brought you to the
ring; hop gif ye can." He had done all that a skilful
commander could do: but the result was a foregone conclusion
unless king Edward was guilty of some gross blunder.</p>

<p>When the English army came in sight of Wallace's
position, the king desired that they should rest and eat
before attacking; but his knights, perhaps remembering
Cambuskenneth, represented that it was not safe to do so,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>with the Scots so near at hand. The first "battle," apparently
consisting entirely of men-at-arms, commanded by the
earl Marshal, accordingly advanced to the attack, found the
stream impassable, and had to make a wide circuit to the
left. The second division, under the warlike bishop of
Durham, saw the obstacle and turned it on the right.
Seeing how far the earl Marshal had to go, the bishop tried
to check the impetuosity of his men, till the king with the
third "battle" should be at hand to support them; but
Ralph Basset rudely told him that he had better attend to
his own business of saying mass, and not interfere in military
matters. The bishop was a better judge than the knight;
the men-at-arms rode down the Scottish archers, and easily
defeated the small body of horse, but they could make little
impression on the spearmen. The latter could not charge
without breaking their order, but they could and did stand on
the defensive till the English archers came up. Then it was
soon all over with them: the arrows made gaps in their ranks,
through which the horsemen charged, breaking up their
formation, and slaughtering them in thousands. Wallace
drew off the relics of his army towards the Highlands, and
from that time practically disappears from history. Partisanship
has always dealt eagerly with his name: the contemporary
English chroniclers call him <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">latro</i>, the Scots exalt
him into an ideal patriot hero. The truth would seem to be
that, while by no means superior to his age in humanity, he
gave evidence of real ability and integrity in his very difficult
post as guardian of Scotland; moreover, he exhibited
exceptional military skill.</p>

<p>Wallace's "schiltrons," to use the Scottish name for his
great clumps of spearmen, were in truth an important advance
in the art of war; and though they were not in fact a
novelty, they were no doubt a real invention on his part, for
it is scarcely conceivable that he should ever have heard of
the Macedonian phalanx. The natural formation for men
armed with spears is close together, in line, the ranks being
drawn up one behind the other, two, four or more deep.
Such a line can hold its own against attacks in front, and
can advance: but if it is once broken it can be destroyed,
and it is almost helpless if its flank is turned. This was
substantially the sole order of battle during the palmy days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>of Greece. Philip of Macedon improved upon it by forming
the phalanx, a solid square of pikemen, who faced outwards
in case of need, and could not therefore be taken in flank.
The phalanx moved slowly, and hardly at all over rough
ground; and it obviously had no power of vigorous attack.
Hence in its turn it was beaten by the Roman legionaries,
who threw their heavy <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pila</i> from a short distance, and then
charged sword in hand. With the fall of the Roman Empire
the military art, like all others, had suffered eclipse in
western Europe; and though the Anglo-Danes with their
axes and shields had reproduced in some sense the Roman
tactics, yet from the day of Hastings, when they went down
before the feudal horsemen of the Normans, the mailed
chivalry had been everywhere dominant. The political
preponderance of the feudal nobility was partly cause, partly
effect, of their military supremacy. They alone could
procure, for themselves and their following, the armour
which rendered them almost invulnerable to the ill-armed
foot-soldier: the contempt they felt for the villein and the
trader seemed justified by the facility with which they could
slaughter the lower classes in the field. Slowly the pike
reappeared on the scene, in the hands of peoples who were
not over-ridden entirely by feudalism, and who had to
defend themselves against men-at-arms. It is Wallace's
most undoubted title to fame, if not his highest glory, that
he was the first to organise plebeian spearmen afresh, not
indeed for victory,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> but with success as against mailed horsemen
only. It was the combination of archers with the
men-at-arms which won Falkirk for king Edward, just as
the same combination had won Hastings for William the
Norman. The great difference lay in the fact that in times
wholly feudal the credit of the victory of Hastings went
entirely to the knights, whereas Edward <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> was wiser: from
the day of Falkirk onwards the archers became more and
more the mainstay of an English army.</p>

<p>England has been destined in three wars to experience
the truth that a country whose people refuse to submit to
invaders cannot practically be conquered, however superior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>may be the invaders in military skill or resources: in a
fourth war she helped the Spaniards to exemplify the same
maxim. Between England and Scotland at the beginning
of the fourteenth century no comparison was possible; the
southern people were wealthier, more numerous, better
organised. Yet the war begun by Wallace's brief career
ended in the establishment of Scottish independence. So
also the French had no chance in the field against the
English of Edward <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> and Henry <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr>; yet the English
attempt at conquering France ended in total failure. The
little English armies won nearly every engagement against
the revolted American colonists; yet the task of subjugating
the colonies would have been hopeless, even if
other enemies had not assailed England, and hastened the
catastrophe.</p>

<p>Edward <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> won a great victory at Falkirk, but he never
was able to subdue Scotland. Just before his death the
Scots found a new leader in Robert Bruce, representing the
house rival to the Balliols at the time of the disputed
succession and now accepted instead of them, who was duly
crowned king. Edward's death stopped a great invasion of
Scotland, and his incompetent son neglected Scottish affairs,
till gradually the whole country was lost except Stirling
Castle. This was, as has been pointed out, the most important
post in Scotland: but it could not be held indefinitely,
and the governor ultimately agreed to surrender
unless relieved before Midsummer day 1314. Edward <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>
was driven for once into activity, and approached just in
time, with an army to which the chroniclers ascribe the
incredible number of 100,000 men. Robert Bruce had no
choice but to await attack at Stirling: if he marched to
meet his enemy, it was obvious that the English might evade
him and reach Stirling unopposed. They might even, with
their great superiority of numbers,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> engage him on more
than equal terms, and have plenty to spare to be pushed
forward to Stirling. Fortunately for him, he had an
admirable position ready to his hand within a very short
distance.</p>

<p>About 2&frac12; miles south of Stirling a small stream, the
Bannockburn, flows from west to east, and then curving
northwards flows into the Forth. Between it and Stirling
lay the king's park, in which the Scottish army camped.
The position chosen for receiving battle was immediately
behind this stream. Bruce, who was comparatively weak in
horsemen, had to depend, like Wallace, mainly on his spearmen
for receiving the charge of the English men-at-arms.
Barbour's long-winded poem on the life and acts of Robert
Bruce, from which is derived the traditional account of the
battle, contains sundry picturesque incidents, the truth of
which need not be doubted, though he indulges in a vast
amount of patriotic exaggeration. He does not, however,
give the details in a form which renders the battle really
intelligible. For instance, he describes minutely the "pots,"
round holes a foot broad and as deep as a man's knee,
covered over with sticks and grass all green, which were
intended to break the charge of the English horse. But he
does not say where, relatively to the army, these pots were:
nor does he mention them as having answered their purpose.
An English chronicler, Baker of Swinbrook, describes a
ditch, three feet deep and wide, as having been dug along
the whole front, and covered over with hurdles and grass,
into which the first line of the English fell; and the confusion
thus occasioned involved the defeat of the English.
Neither refers to the burn as having been any obstacle;
Barbour indeed mentions houses having been pulled down
by the English, with the timbers of which they made bridges
over certain pools, but he does not say where the pools
were. It is possible that as the battle was fought at midsummer,
and Barbour lays great stress on the intense heat,
the marshy ground on the north of it was unusually dry and
firm; otherwise it is not obvious why Bruce should have
wanted either pots or ditch.</p>

<p>The English host, marching from the direction of Linlithgow,
came in sight of the Scottish position in the afternoon
of June 23. When they were about two miles off, a
body of 800 men-at-arms under Clifford was sent forward to
try and pass by the left of the Scottish army, between it and
the lower course of the burn, so as to reach Stirling Castle.
Had this attempt succeeded the castle might have been said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>to be relieved in time to save the promised surrender: and
it was within an ace of succeeding. Thomas Randolph,
earl of Moray, Bruce's nephew, commanded on the Scottish
left; and it was only on Bruce's express order, telling him
that a rose had fallen from his chaplet, that he hastened
with a body of spearmen to place himself, just in time,
across their path. The spearmen formed a clump, like a
hedgehog with all his spikes out, and the English horsemen
were unable to break their array. James of Douglas, seeing
that Moray was very hard pressed, asked the king's permission
to go to his assistance. Bruce for the moment
allowed his chivalrous instincts to overcome his judgment
as a general, and wished to leave Moray to take his chance,
but on Douglas urging him consented. On the approach
of reinforcements, the English saw that the opportunity was
lost, and retired. Douglas, in the true spirit of the age,
abstained from pursuit, lest he should rob Moray of any of
the glory of having repulsed them.</p>

<p>Edward <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, on coming fully in front of the Scots, ordered
a halt, but the order was not made known in time to prevent
some of the vanguard from coming into collision with them.
According to the fashion of the time, Sir Henry Bohun rode
out in advance, and seeing Bruce in front of his line charged
at him. The king was mounted on a pony, but did not avoid
the combat, as in any age when a commander was not a
knight first and a general afterwards he certainly would and
ought to have done, and killed the Englishman. The story
goes that the Scottish lords, having better sense than their
king, blamed him for having risked his life, which might
have meant the ruin of every one, and that Bruce's sole
answer was that he was sorry he had broken his battle-axe.
The English vanguard, on seeing the issue of this duel,
retired again without coming into serious collision with the
Scots, and doubtless feeling the omen to be a bad one.</p>

<p>Next morning early the battle commenced in earnest, and
the authorities are hopelessly at variance as to what happened.
Barbour describes the attack of the English men-at-arms
on the Scots in their position, with severe fighting
which ended in their defeat. Incidentally he mentions Sir
Robert Keith having charged into the flank of the English
archers with five hundred men armed with steel that on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>light horse were horsed well, and having totally discomfited
them so that they did not shoot any more. But he does
not say where the archers were posted, and as he declares
there were 52,000 of them, it is simply impossible to accept
his story. More than one English chronicler says that the
English front line was formed of archers and spearmen,
with the mounted men-at-arms behind: but they do not
explain what became of the front line. It has been suggested
as an explanation that the archers were so far in
advance of the men-at-arms that the Scottish horse were
able to charge and disperse them before they were supported:
but this is scarcely possible, as the whole English
array was too near. Baker of Swinbrook says that the
archers were in the second line, and as he carefully adds
that it was a great mistake not placing them on the flanks of
the men-at-arms, as was done afterwards, his informant may
be presumed to have noted the point. According to his
account, which is the most intelligible and coherent, the
English men-at-arms charged straight on the Scottish front,
were thrown into utter confusion by the front rank falling
into Bruce's concealed ditch and the hinder lines pressing
on, and were slaughtered helplessly by the Scots, who
reserved only the rich for ransom. The archers seeing the
disaster, tried to shoot over their heads; but many of them,
in the excitement of battle shooting straight to their front,
"struck a few Scots in the breast and many English in the
back." The crush and hopeless confusion will be all the
more intelligible when it is remembered that the space
occupied by the Scots was far too narrow to give room for
the charging masses, who consequently impeded and overthrew
each other. The fight was still going on, when over
the little hill above the Scottish right, which has ever since
been known as the Gillies' hill, appeared the "yeomen and
swaynes" of the Scottish army, who had rigged up an
apology for banners, so that they seemed to the English to
be a large reinforcement to the Scots, coming to take them
in flank. A panic seized that portion of the army which
was not engaged, and they fled in confusion, the king himself
following their example.</p>

<p>Whatever uncertainty may hang over the details, there is
no doubt about the completeness of the victory. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>number of the slain may well have been large, seeing how
the knights and men-at-arms were crowded together in a
confused mass, incapable of resistance. The gross incompetence
of Edward <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> or his advisers, who with all the
material for victory in their hands, and the precedent of
Falkirk to guide them, threw their advantage away, was
responsible for the defeat. Their hasty flight was also probably
the cause of the dispersion in panic rout of the whole
English host, a disgrace which has never since fallen on an
English army. According to Barbour, the king with his
immediate attendants sought shelter in Stirling Castle, and
was refused admittance by Mowbray the governor, who
pointed out that the castle could not hold out long, now
that the English army was defeated, and that therefore the
king's only chance of safety lay in making off. How Edward
could possibly have made his way round to Stirling Castle,
with the victorious Scots between him and it, can with difficulty
be imagined. The advice, however, if ever given, was
sound as far as it went. Better judgment still would have
bidden him rally his host, for even after the defeat he must
still have greatly outnumbered the Scots. But if he had
been capable of taking this obvious and soldierlike step, he
would not have committed the folly which lost the battle.</p>

<p>The victory of Bannockburn virtually gained the cause of
Scottish independence, though fourteen years had yet to
elapse before England acknowledged it by treaty. That the
Scots fully deserved to win their independence, and that
they had a right to win it if they could, no one in modern
times will deny. No impartial reader of history can doubt
that in some sense they had been dependent on England
before the war, or that the exaggerated claims of Edward <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>
gave reasonable ground for repudiating them entirely.
Whether the success of the Scots was for their permanent
benefit is another question. The union of the whole island
into one kingdom was, it may be fairly said, inevitable
sooner or later. Scotland must needs have gained enormously
in all material respects by incorporation with her more
advanced neighbour. Had this taken place before centuries
of political antagonism and repeated wars had developed
national hatred, and quickened into a passion Scottish
national feeling, the union would have been easier and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>more thorough. With Scotland added, instead of permanently
hostile, the weight of England in the European
scale, already great, would have been much increased, with
consequences impossible to calculate. At the same time
the world would have been the poorer for the loss of the
distinctive character, which was developed in the Scots
mainly through their separate Reformation.</p>

<h3>INTERMEDIATE NOTE<br />

<small>THE LONG-BOW</small></h3>


<p>The long-bow is like many other inventions which have
played a great part in history: its origin is obscure. The bow
in some form is almost as old as the human race; but it on the
whole was regarded as the weapon of inferior soldiers, down to
near the time when the invention of gunpowder was destined
to render it altogether antiquated. We have seen that the
Norman archers at Hastings, skilfully used, contributed greatly
to the victory: but the evidence of the Bayeux Tapestry may be
taken as conclusive that these bows were only the short bows of
the ancient world. Richard <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, the only really warlike king
between the Conqueror and Edward <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, took pains to introduce
the cross-bow, then a comparatively new weapon.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It is incredible
that the ablest soldier, as Richard undoubtedly was,
even of an ignorant age, should have preferred the cross-bow
to a weapon which could beat it at every point. Hence we
must conclude that the feats of archery attributed to Robin Hood,
Richard's contemporary, were reflected back upon his memory
from a later time, when such feats were no longer impossible.
In the Barons' War the archers play no important part; but in
the course of the reign of Edward <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, the long-bow came into
general use. Edward used his archers with such effect at
Falkirk, that it may fairly be inferred that he had long before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>seen the value of the long-bow and taken steps to foster the use
of it, though even then they were employed as an afterthought,
to help the horsemen, who alone could not break the Scottish
spears. There is nothing like clear evidence as to the locality
which developed the long-bow, which not only exceeded the
older bows in size and power, but was used in a different manner,
though there are slight indications suggesting that South Wales
had that honour. At any rate in the fourteenth century it was
the familiar and trusted weapon of the English, the instrument
of their great and repeated victories.</p>

<p>Archery, as an amusement, has lost much of its popularity of
late years, being superseded by other sports which demand less
space and afford more active exercise. Probably however every
Englishman, if a bow were put into his hands, would instinctively
draw it more or less in the right fashion, whether he has ever seen
an arrow shot off or not. That is to say he would hold it upright,
and draw the string back on his right side, standing himself
sideways. Before the introduction of the English long-bow, all
archers held their bows more or less horizontal, and drew the
string to their bodies. The advantages of the English method
are probably obvious: at any rate the briefest experiment will
render them so. First, a much longer bow can be drawn to the
side than to the breast, which enables a longer and therefore
more powerful arrow to be used. Secondly, a much stronger
bow can be pulled in that way, which means greater penetrating
force. Thirdly, if the long-bow is drawn correctly, the arrow is
brought up close to the right ear, which enables the archer to
look along the arrow, and aim it with considerable accuracy,
whereas obviously no arrow drawn to the breast could be really
aimed. Practice makes perfect, in archery more than in many
other things: the English archers of the fourteenth century practised
assiduously, and attained corresponding proficiency. The
regular practising distance was a furlong,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> which implies that
arrows discharged at a high elevation would travel much further.
In fact we find "a bow shot" used as a rough measure of distance,
equivalent to about 400 yards. If they struck armour
obliquely, of course they would be likely to glance and not
penetrate; but it required the very best steel to stop an arrow
which struck full and true. Add the fact that a trained archer
could shoot with astonishing rapidity, so that the arrows in their
flight dazzled and bewildered the enemies at whom they were
aimed, and still more their horses: and we have the picture of
a missile weapon unequalled till the introduction of the rifle.</p>

<p>Why the long-bow should have remained, as in fact it did,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>the exclusive property of the English, is a mystery. It is true
that archers could not stand alone: they required the assistance
of troops differently armed, to protect them against determined
attack by mailed horsemen in adequate numbers. It is true also
that the long-bow needed considerable muscular strength for
using it; and the average Englishman had probably the advantage
in this respect over the average Frenchman, then as now.
But Lowland Scots are to all intents and purposes of the same
race, yet they went on generation after generation losing their
fights large and small against the English, chiefly through the
archers, yet never learning to shoot. The explanation may
perhaps be that among all who came to feel the power of the
clothyard shaft, feudal pride was too stubborn to be taught
quickly, so that gunpowder was coming into use before they
had digested the lesson. Whatever the cause, the fact is certain
that the English kept their monopoly of the long-bow, and consequently
were, for a century at least, supreme on the field of
battle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>CRECY AND POITIERS</small></h2>


<p>A few months after the accession of Edward <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>, his
uncle the king of France died. Edward had a claim in
right of his mother, which, if the crown of France had been
a bit of land, to be inherited according to the subtleties of
English real property law, would have been plausible, if not
sound. The conclusive answer to his claim however lay in
the fact that France had a right to settle the matter in her
own way. If there was a law of succession, which from the
jurist's point of view is more than doubtful,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> it was against
Edward: if there was not, the peers of France, who must
be taken to constitute France for this purpose, chose Philip
of Valois. Edward's pretensions were not seriously urged,
and he acknowledged the new king as his suzerain for the
duchy of Guienne; but disputed questions were left open
both as to the amount of territory belonging to Edward,
and as to the nature of his homage for it to the king of
France. Peace was not broken for ten years, but Philip <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr>
showed himself steadily hostile, assisting Edward's enemies
in Scotland, interfering with English commerce, encroaching
in Guienne. Philip was entirely unscrupulous, and naturally
desirous of carrying on the work of his predecessors, by
obtaining effective possession of another of the great feudal
domains over which the king of France had titular suzerainty.
The south-west had never acknowledged more than
the most nominal inferiority: it is no paradox to say that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>the Plantagenets defended the ancient independence of
Aquitaine against French aggression.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Nevertheless the
people of Aquitaine had closer affinities of race and language
with France than with England: the ultimate and
natural result of the war was to make them French subjects.</p>

<p>Finding war inevitable, Edward <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> thought to rouse the
enthusiasm of his subjects by reviving his claim to the
French crown. Without the cordial support of England
Edward was weaker than his rival; with it he was, as the
event showed, very decidedly stronger. England was, and
had been for two centuries, a nation in the true sense of
the word: it needed the long agony of the Hundred Years'
War to give France real national coherence. Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>
had given England a strong central administration, with a
system of law fairly equal and well enforced. Ever since
the barons had extorted Magna Charta from John, not for
themselves only but for the whole people, the powers of the
Parliament, and its significance as the representative body
of the nation, had been growing. No laws could be made,
no new taxation could be imposed, without the advice and
consent of Parliament. This was only the beginning of
political liberty, in the modern sense, but it was a beginning.
In France on the other hand the king ruled over a number
of vassals who had little or no relation to each other, and
each of whom was much more effectually master of his
dependents than the king. The political contrast showed
itself in the military organisation of the two kingdoms.
Though Edward <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> was deeply imbued with the spirit of
chivalry, he was far too sensible to carry into the field the
noble's absolute contempt for the villein. Moreover there
existed in England a class of yeomen who were in fact
completely above villeinage, from which on the whole the
archers were drawn. The feudal rule, by which the king
summoned his vassals to serve him in war, and they came
with their following (or did not come if they were disinclined,
and the king lacked force to coerce them), had long
been obsolete in England. The Parliament granted the
king money for war, to supplement his own resources; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>the king agreed with individual noblemen to bring so many
men into the field, who were adequately paid and came
voluntarily; hence they tended to make war their business,
and to acquire something like discipline.</p>

<p>Edward had not far to look for allies. The commercial
relations between England and Flanders were close, and
highly important to both. The Flemish cities, then at the
height of their prosperity, had recently quarrelled with their
count, who appealed to his suzerain the king of France;
and they promised Edward much more assistance than in
fact they afforded. However Flanders gave him a base of
operations as against France, and the first years of the war
were occupied in more or less futile efforts at invasion,
though they brought an overwhelming victory over the
French fleet at Sluys on the Flemish coast. Later, a disputed
succession to the duchy of Brittany, in which the
candidate rejected by the king of France naturally asked
help from England, opened a new field for hostility. In
1345 there was serious fighting in Guienne, in the course of
which the earl of Derby won a considerable victory at
Auberoche. On the other hand the murder of Jacques van
Artevelde, the virtual ruler of Flanders and a strong partisan
of England, made the prospects of effectual support
from the Flemings worse than ever. The English Parliament,
though desiring peace, probably realised that it was
hopeless except at the price of abandoning Guienne, and
therefore wisely desired that war should be waged in
earnest. Great preparations were made for the campaign
of 1346, which the king was to conduct in person. The
king of France had raised a very large army, which was
commanded by his son the duke of Normandy, and which
early in 1346 occupied part of the English possessions in
the south-west of France. The obvious thing for Edward
to do with the large expedition he was fitting out was to
defend his own provinces, since Flanders now offered a
very unpromising field. Instead of this he decided suddenly
to invade Normandy,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and on July 12 he landed at
Cape La Hogue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_b_058"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_058.jpg" width="400" height="589" alt="Map IV: Campaigns of Crecy and Agincourt." />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no evidence that Edward had formed any
coherent plan of operations. Able tactician as he showed
himself at Crecy, he was no strategist; indeed no one in
that age had any idea of strategical combinations, though of
course it is easy after the event to see that a particular
direction given to an army was or was not judicious from
this point of view. This invasion of France might have
been an extremely brilliant stroke. The English command
of the sea made it feasible to land almost anywhere; the
main French army was engaged in the south-west: there
were no preparations for attempting to meet invasion anywhere
else. Had Edward landed near the mouth of the
Seine, at the nearest point to the capital, and marched
straight on Paris, he would have had the king of France
almost at his mercy, for Paris might have been in his hands
before the duke of Normandy could come to its rescue.
Instead of this, Edward landed at the extremity of the
Cotentin peninsula, and then marched in a leisurely way
through Normandy, capturing and plundering town after
town, there being virtually no resistance. The absolute
vagueness of his intentions may be gathered from his having
sent away his fleet, laden with the booty of the Norman
towns, thus depriving himself of the means of retreat in case
of need. If Froissart is to be believed, he had already
determined to march on Calais and attempt to seize it; but
if so, it is still more difficult to explain his having landed in
the Cotentin, Calais being within a march or two of Flanders,
where if he had not met with much support he would have
at least found a friendly reception. The only thing which
looks as if he really meant to go towards Calais is that
having reached Louviers, he seems to have marched some
way down the Seine again towards Rouen; but this may
have been in the hope of being able to plunder the capital
of Normandy. The French meanwhile had broken down
all the bridges on the Seine, which can only have been in
order to prevent the English from extending their ravages
to the right bank of the Seine, as it was obvious that they
could reach the coast as easily on one side as on the other.
Whatever may have been his original plan, or want of one,
Edward, unable to cross the Seine in Normandy, did what
he ought to have done weeks before, and marched up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>left bank towards Paris. The king of France had used the
breathing time unwisely allowed him to collect an army,
which is said to have amounted to 100,000 men. Why he
made no attempt to interfere with Edward earlier is a
mystery. The English king marched unopposed to Poissy,
a few miles below Paris, and there amused himself, while
the bridge was being rebuilt, in ravaging the country to the
very gates of the capital; he no doubt knew that the city
was by this time full of soldiers, and therefore not open to
attack. On August 16 the bridge was finished, and Edward
crossed the Seine, his advanced guard having a sharp but
successful fight with a large body of men coming from
Amiens to join king Philip. Seeing that the huge French
army was gathered at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Denis, on the right bank, nearly
half-way to Poissy, it is equally mysterious to find Edward
crossing the Seine close to an enormously superior force,
and Philip making no attempt to take him at a disadvantage.
However Edward had by this time resolved on making for
Flanders, and marched hastily northwards, sending out a
strong detachment to endeavour to seize some point of
passage over the Somme. As was natural, these were all
broken or defended; Edward went on down the Somme,
with an enemy of four or five times his strength behind
him, till on August 23 he came opposite Abbeville, below
which the river becomes a tidal estuary. The town was
fortified and garrisoned, and there was a large body of
troops on the right bank: it looked as if Edward's reckless
movements had led him at last into a trap, as if the
king of France had achieved a success which his own
military management had by no means deserved. In the
nick of time a peasant told Edward of a ford some way
below Abbeville, broad and firm, but available only at low
water. Early on the morning of the 24th the English
army crossed by this ford, the archers giving a foretaste
of what was to happen at Crecy by completely driving off
the French force stationed to defend it. They were barely
across when Philip was upon them; but the rising tide
prevented pursuit.</p>

<p>Edward was now safe: he had only a short march before
him to reach Flanders. Here however the spirit of chivalry
took possession of him: he chose to turn and await battle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>saying that he was now in his own heritage,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and would
defend it against the usurper. Accordingly he encamped
on August 25 near the little village of Crecy, and selected a
position in which to give battle, into which he moved the
next morning. The army was divided as usual into three
"battles," each consisting of about 800 men-at-arms and
2000 archers, besides light-armed infantry, chiefly Welsh.
The prince of Wales commanded the first, the earl of
Northampton the second: the king kept the third, which
was to act as a reserve, under his own immediate orders.
The exact position is not easy to determine: but it was on
a piece of sloping ground, with a wind-mill on the upper
part of it at which the king took up his station, facing
the south-east or nearly so. The French attacked in such
a hasty and irrational manner that it is not safe to infer
anything from what they did: but certainly they did not
attempt, with all their vast superiority of numbers, to turn
Edward's position. A competent tactician would most probably
have taken care that his flanks were protected in some
way; and therefore it is probable that the English right
rested on Crecy, through which flows the little river Maye,
in which case its left may have been covered by the adjoining
hamlet of Wadicourt. This position is shown in the
accompanying map, not as ascertained, but as answering
well to the conditions.</p>

<p>The essential novelty in Edward's tactics, the fact which
makes Crecy an epoch in the history of the art of war, was
that having to fight with very inferior numbers he discerned
an effective way of combining the two elements of his army.
He caused all the men-at-arms to dismount, and placed the
horses with the baggage in an enclosed park in rear. The
men-at-arms were to serve simply as spearmen, like the
Scots at Falkirk and Bannockburn: they were to form the
solid line of resistance, while the archers shot down the
assailants. There is a certain discrepancy between the
accounts, as to the position of the archers. Froissart says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>that they were drawn up in front, after the fashion of a
harrow (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">herse</i>).<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Baker of Swinbrook says very precisely
that they were put on the wings, so as not to be in the way
of the men-at-arms, nor meet the enemy in front, but shoot
into their flanks. The two may be reconciled, if we bear in
mind that the archers would naturally not be drawn up in
the same straight line with the men-at-arms, but thrown
forward at an angle, so as to allow them to shoot more
freely at the advancing enemy. Moreover it is certain that
the prince of Wales' "battle" was on the right, in front,
Northampton's on the left, a very little further back, perhaps
because of some slight irregularity in the ground. If
each division had part of its archers on each flank, thrown
somewhat forward, the two inner lines of archers would
meet at an angle: and the whole front would present an
appearance not very unlike a harrow.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_b_062"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_062.jpg" width="400" height="78" alt="Harrow shape" />
</div>

<p>All through the middle of the day (August 26) the English
sat in their lines, waiting quietly for the enemy. As
evening drew near the French host came in sight: the
knights and men-at-arms were divided into nine "battles,"
but no attempt had been made to form any plan of action,
or even to make the commanders of them understand that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>they were expected to obey general orders. There was also
a large body, 15,000 it is said, of Genoese cross-bowmen,
besides an indefinite number of ill-armed peasants who
only served to cumber the space. On hearing from certain
knights who had pushed forward that the English were
drawn up to await attack, the king of France, in accordance
with their advice, ordered a halt, intending his army
to bivouac where it was, and to form regularly for battle
the next morning. On the word being given, the front
halted, but those in rear pushed on, saying they would not
halt till they were equal with those in front. Neither the
king nor the marshals could assert any authority over the
rabble of nobles and knights, and they advanced anyhow
till they were close in front of the English position. Then
the king, seeing that it was too late to avoid an action,
ordered the Genoese forward. Just as the sun was close
on its setting, and shining full in the face of the French
line, the battle began. The cross-bowmen advanced, shouting,
but the English never stirred; presently they began
to shoot. The English archers then took one step forward,
and shot their arrows with such force and quickness
that it seemed to be snowing. The cross-bow bolts fell
short: the clothyard arrows totally discomfited the Genoese,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
already worn out with a long hot march. Therefore
the king of France, with the true feudal contempt
for all that was not noble, bade the men-at-arms trample
down these rascals. The knights, nothing loth, rode over
the unhappy Genoese, and charged tumultuously on the
English front. Men and horses went down in heaps before
the arrows, which were shot from both flanks into the surging
mob. Those who escaped fell furiously on the English
line, and were with difficulty kept at bay. It shows how
blindly the French came on, that the main stress fell on
the prince of Wales, who was on the right, and therefore in
the part of the line nearest to the French coming from
Abbeville: Northampton on his left seems to have had
much less to do. Time after time the French charged,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>with the effect of adding to the heaps of dead and wounded:
between the charges the English bill-men slipped out
through the front line to kill and take prisoners. Edward,
who was watching the whole course of the action from
his post on the higher ground, was once appealed to for
help for his son: he could see that there was no real need,
and refused it, saying, according to the well-known story,
"Let the boy win his spurs." One account tells how the
king sent twenty knights down, who found the prince and
his men sitting on the heaps of slain, resting themselves
while the enemy were withdrawn and preparing for a fresh
charge. Darkness at length put an end to the battle.
Edward was far too prudent to attempt a counter attack:
he owed his victory to firmly maintaining the position he
had chosen, and could not afford to risk a disaster by quitting
it. The slaughter on the French side had been frightful&mdash;4000
knights and men-at-arms, and uncounted multitudes
besides: the English loss had naturally been but slight.</p>

<p>A tinge of romance is always supposed to be thrown over
Crecy by the conduct of the blind king of Bohemia, who
caused some of his knights to lead him in one of the
charges, the bridles of the whole party being fastened
together, with the natural result of all being killed. But as
he had no sort of concern with the quarrel, one feels rather
inclined to dismiss him with Polonius' epitaph&mdash;</p>

<p>It would seem as if, after such a victory, Edward <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>
might have resumed the offensive, with good prospect of
reducing the king of France to sue for peace. But it must
be remembered that his army was relatively small, that the
battle had been won in a defensive position, and that he
could not possibly know how soon he might find himself
face to face with the duke of Normandy's army recalled
from Guienne. It rather speaks well for Edward's military
judgment that he should have quietly carried out his previous
design, and marched on Calais, which he succeeded
in taking after an unexpectedly long siege, and which furnished
from that day forth a ready door into France.
Small however as the direct and immediate results of the
battle of Crecy were, it was in its ultimate consequences of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a><br /><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a><br /><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>incalculable importance. Superficially it resembles Bannockburn:
a very superior army, badly and presumptuously
led, attacks an inferior enemy well posted for defence, and
is decisively and deservedly beaten. The difference lies a
little deeper, in the fact that the foremost kingdom in
Europe in point of national organisation, ruled as it was by
a king who was the mirror of chivalry, adopted tactics which
could and must overthrow feudal chivalry. All ranks and
classes fought side by side, and fought on foot; the men-at-arms,
the archers, the bill-men all contributed their share.
Such a victory would naturally stimulate national feeling
more than twenty won by the knights alone. And such
victories, as the event showed, were sure to be repeated, as
often as opportunity offered. The French, as will be seen,
were slow to learn the lesson: but from Crecy may fairly
be dated the preponderance of infantry, though much time
elapsed, and many changes in the battle-field were seen,
before this was finally established.</p>

</div>

<p>The capture of Calais in 1347 was followed by a truce,
which, largely on account of the frightful ravages of the
Black Death in both countries, was renewed again and
again. In 1350 Philip <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> died, and was succeeded by his
son John, who continued his father's policy. Year after
year there were acts of hostility, chiefly but by no means
exclusively on the French side, and abortive negotiations
for peace. Edward offered repeatedly to resign his claims
to the French crown on terms, but the price he asked was
larger than the king of France could be expected to pay.
At length in 1355 Edward was led by offered co-operation
from the king of Navarre, which however came to nothing,
to invade France in earnest once more. Two subsidiary
expeditions were foiled by the winds, but the main one was
carried out, and led to the great victory of Poitiers. The
Black Prince, who commanded it, and who thenceforth was
his father's representative in France, led a successful plundering
expedition from Bordeaux across the south of
France, but avoided serious fighting. Early in July the
next year the prince started for a similar expedition on a
larger scale, striking this time into the very heart of France.
Two or three weeks earlier, the duke of Lancaster had left
Brittany to unite with some Norman nobles who had risen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>in rebellion: and it is supposed by some writers that the
two invasions were parts of a concerted scheme, by which
the English hoped finally to conquer France. The direction
of the Black Prince's march, the leisurely character of his
proceedings, and the amount of plunder carried off, make
this view highly improbable. Ignorance of topography, and
the necessity of avoiding strong places which could not be
captured, might account for some deviations from the
straight route; the necessity of living on the country might
account for the loss of a few days. It is not impossible
that, aiming merely at the Loire, he should have gone as
far east as Vierzon, instead of taking the direct route by
Poitiers to Tours. But it is incredible that with such an
object in view he should have consumed about three times
the number of days necessary for covering the distance, or
that he should have deliberately burdened his march with
vast quantities of plunder. The prince was certainly a
competent soldier for his age: and all accounts agree that
his army was thoroughly under control, and that the
plundering was systematic. He doubtless knew of his
cousin's enterprise: but that there was intended to be real
co-operation between them could only be believed on very
good and positive evidence, which does not exist.</p>

<p>The duke of Lancaster had in fact effected nothing: he
had been obliged to retreat before the vastly superior
armies brought to bear against him: but king John was
still occupied in reducing the rebellious towns, when he
heard somewhat tardily of the Black Prince's march. He
instantly went to Chartres, and there gathered a large army,
besides garrisoning every town on the Loire, to guard
against the Black Prince crossing that river and making his
way into Normandy.</p>

<p>The prince had by this time reached Vierzon, after
plundering and destroying unresisted across Angoumois,
La Marche and Berri. He there heard that the king of
France was assembling a large army on the Loire, and
therefore gave up all thought of continuing his elaborate
raid. One would have thought that the necessity of prompt
action, seeing that he had only from 8000 to 10,000 men,
would have been sufficiently obvious: but the chivalric
point of honour was of so much importance that he wasted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>several days in taking the castle of Romorantin, which had
offered unexpected resistance. It was a fortunate piece of
rashness, for otherwise the French king would not have
compelled him to fight at Poitiers.</p>

<p>There seems to be no doubt that the Black Prince thought
of crossing the Loire; but this gives no real support to the
theory that his whole expedition was made in concert with
Lancaster. Of course each was generally aware that the
other was going to move, which would imply the possibility,
if both succeeded, of their meeting somewhere thereabouts;
but this is a very long way from deliberate co-operation.
He might well have thought that if he could pass the Loire
he would have as safe a refuge, would harass and perplex
the French king more, and would not seem to have been
driven to retreat; otherwise he would certainly have never
gone near Poitiers, but would have followed a line of retreat
as straight on Bordeaux as possible, every march in which
would take him further from king John's overwhelming
army. Some of the authorities trace his route, some do
not; the places named do not always agree, and are not all
to be certainly identified. The most precise of them says
that he went straight to Tours, remained near that city
several days hoping to cross the river there, and decamped
south on hearing that the French king was crossing at
Blois. The same account states that king John through his
scouts was acquainted with the prince's movements: if so,
one would think he ought to have made a little more haste.
When he did move however the French king marched not
straight towards his enemy, but in a direction intended
to intercept his retreat, a piece of strategy which may
seem obvious enough, but not so common in the middle
ages. From Loches he directed his army on Poitiers, the
main part with the king in person crossing the Vienne at
the bridge of Chauvigny, fifteen miles east of that city.
The slight information which each side had of the other,
seems to have failed totally at the critical juncture. On
Friday September 16 king John slept between Chauvigny
and Poitiers, in complete ignorance where the Black Prince
was. The same night the prince was a few miles north of
the Chauvigny-Poitiers road, in equal ignorance that his
enemy was between him and safety. Starting early on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>17th, the prince took, none too soon, the precaution of
sending a small troop of men-at-arms forward to reconnoitre.
These fell in with the last of king John's great army to
cross the bridge of Chauvigny; it would be an abuse of
language to call them a rearguard. Outnumbered four to
one, the English<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> fell back on the main body, and the
French pursuing heedlessly were nearly all killed or captured.
The prince, thus warned of the proximity of his enemy,
pushed on a few miles further, till he was well on the
Bordeaux side of Poitiers, and there halted. King John, on
hearing the news, ordered his forces to retrace their steps,
and passed the night of the 17th about three miles south-east
of Poitiers.</p>

<p>The locality of the battle of Poitiers, or Maupertuis as the
French name it, has now been ascertained. Documentary
evidence shows that the spot formerly called Maupertuis is
La Cardinerie, a farm near the Limoges road, about five
miles south-east of Poitiers. This disposes of the theory
of the battle, based upon expressions of the chroniclers to
the effect that the Black Prince could not help fighting, that
the French army was between him and Bordeaux. It also
destroys all ground for the charge against king John of
wasteful folly in attacking his enemy strongly posted, when
that enemy had no choice, unless he would starve or surrender,
but to attack an enormously superior force. The
Black Prince, it is clear, was not cut off: he had the choice
between standing to fight, and attempting to escape from
the French, who were within two or three miles of him, and
several times his strength. There is no doubt, further, that
the Black Prince selected the strongest position available,
fortified it to the best of his power, and there awaited
attack. He evidently thought that it was scarcely possible
to get away in safety, or else he would certainly not have
halted comparatively early in the day.</p>

<p>The position was a strong one, for the arms of that age.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>Like his father, the Black Prince, though his strategy might
be faulty, possessed great tactical skill, and coolness in
encountering danger. The essentials for his situation were,
ample scope for his archers, all possible impediments to the
French horsemen, and some security against being attacked
on all sides at once, seeing how great were the odds against
him. All these conditions he managed to fulfil, and all
would hardly have sufficed to save him from destruction,
but for the disastrous blunder of the French, in dismounting
to attack.</p>

<p>The scene of the battle is slightly undulating country, the
variations of level being only a few feet. The chroniclers,
to whom language for expressing minute differences was
wanting, talk of hills and deep valleys, and have thereby
misled writers who have not seen the ground, nor examined
with attention a contoured map. South-eastwards from
Poitiers runs the modern Limoges road, almost parallel to
an ancient Roman road, which may have been still the
working road of the fourteenth century. A small rivulet, the
Miosson, flows at the bottom of a ravine, about 100
feet below the level of the battle-field, and joins the Clain
just above Poitiers. The bottom is presumably muddy,
and the quantity of water varies greatly with the season.
But there is a ford (the <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Gu√© de l'Homme</span> marked on the
map) to which a narrow road, believed on good evidence
to be ancient, leads from close to La Cardinerie. That
farm itself is not so old as the battle, having taken the place
of the hamlet of Maupertuis, which stood somewhere in the
same neighbourhood, and is said to have been destroyed at
the time of the battle. Maupertuis was<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> supplied with
water from a pond, now almost filled up, which used to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>known as "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la mare aux Anglais</span>," and out of which sundry
relics of the battle have been taken. The overflow of this
pond, and doubtless the surface drainage of the immediate
neighbourhood, which in rainy weather might be considerable,
passed down a very slight hollow running nearly north
and south on the Poitiers side of La Cardinerie. As the
soil is soft, and the slope very gentle till near the Miosson,
the bottom of this hollow may well have been boggy. It is
a good illustration of the exaggerated impression conveyed
by the defective vocabulary of the chroniclers, that this
depression of a very few feet is the place best answering to
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">profunda vallis</i>, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">torrens</i> of Baker of Swinbrook,
the chronicler whose narrative of the battle has a far
greater air of precision in details than any other.</p>

<p>Not far on the east side of this little depression was the
Black Prince's position. His front was covered by a hedge
with a ditch in front: Baker expressly mentions a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sepes
subterfossata</i>, and it was the usual custom in Poitou to fence
in this way. Behind it was a space partly planted with
vines, but by no means clear of bushes, on which the
English encamped. The hedge was apparently on rather
lower ground, for the French knights sent to reconnoitre
were able to bring back a pretty accurate report of the
position and numbers of the enemy. Somewhere in this
hedge was a gap left for carts to reach the upper level, the
hedge apparently curving up to it so as to form a sort of
funnel-shaped opening. There is now no long hedge anywhere
east of the wood of Nouaill√©, half a mile to the south-eastwards;
but hedges and ditches disappear easily in a
fertile soil under continuous cultivation. It is most probable,
though it cannot be said to be certainly known, that
the Black Prince's hedge ran from very near La Cardinerie
towards the hamlet of Les Bordes, and that through the gap
passed the road to the <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Gu√© de l'Homme</span>.</p>

<p>On the morning of Sunday September 18, king John,
according to Froissart, sent some knights to reconnoitre the
English position, which he proposed to attack at once. On
hearing their report, the king, we are told, asked them in
what way the attack should be made; and Eustace de
Ribeaumont, their chief, advised the king to make all his
men-at-arms dismount, except a few who were to charge and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>break the English archers. According to Baker of Swinbrook
the advice was given by a Douglas, who had fought
many times against the English, and affirmed that the
English always dismounted their men-at-arms, ever since
their defeat at Bannockburn. Whoever gave the advice, it
was suicidal folly. A little learning is proverbially a
dangerous thing; probably the most dangerous form which
a little learning can assume is to know a fact, and to draw
utterly baseless and absurd inferences from it. Edward <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>
was not routed at Bannockburn because his men-at-arms
fought on horseback, but because they attacked in a confused
and tumultuous manner on ground too narrow for
their numbers. Edward <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> did not win Crecy merely
because his men-at-arms fought on foot, but because he had
learned, alike from the victory of Falkirk and from the
defeat of Bannockburn, how to combine the destroying force
of archers with the defensive firmness of spearmen on foot.
Moreover the difference between offensive and defensive
tactics is fundamental. Horsemen obviously by dismounting
lose most of their <em>momentum</em> for attack; as obviously,
they cannot in any other way stand firm to sustain a charge.
Want of numbers compelled the English, at Crecy and at
Poitiers alike, to stand on the defensive: therefore, and
therefore only, their men-at-arms abandoned their natural
mode of fighting.</p>

<p>Reminiscences of Crecy may well have inclined king
John to try whether some other tactics would not succeed
better than the tumultuous rush of mailed horsemen straight
on a front better protected than at Crecy: but the choice he
made, whether inspired by sheer stupidity, or dictated by the
insane class pride which refused to see in the plebeian archers
the real victors over noble knights, was the worst possible.
With his overwhelming numbers he could have surrounded
the English; he could have kept them fully occupied
in resisting attack while detaching a superior force to cut
their retreat; he could have done anything he pleased. His
defeat was even more crushing than his father's, and was
all the more discreditable, in that it was due to his own
deliberate orders, and not to the undisciplined rush of nobles
too vain-glorious to obey.</p>

<p>Before the battle could begin, however, the cardinal of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>Perigord begged John to let him try to arrange terms with
the Black Prince. There was some division on the subject
in the French councils, some of the king's advisers thinking
that the English could not escape destruction, and that
therefore any concession was folly. The king ultimately
consented, and the whole day was spent by the cardinal in
going to and fro between the two camps. The accounts
vary as to the exact course of these negotiations: very
possibly several offers and counter offers were exchanged.
The king, if he thought his enemies in his power, may
reasonably have proposed very severe terms as the price of
their lives; the prince was apparently ready to concede a
good deal; but all the efforts of the cardinal were unavailing
to bring about an agreement. Whatever the terms finally
offered by the king of France may have been, they were such
as the prince felt he could not honourably accept, while an
appeal to the arbitrament of battle was still open. The
delay enabled the English to improve their defences, probably
by intrenching on their right flank and rear, which had
been protected on their first taking up the position by a
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">lager</i> of waggons. It was injurious in another way, as they
were very short of food; but this mattered little, as the
morrow must bring victory or destruction.</p>

<p>Down to the morning of September 19, the day of the
battle, every detail can be determined, if not with certainty,
yet with reasonable probability. At this point, however, we
encounter very serious difficulties. The two authorities
which describe the battle minutely, Froissart and Baker,
differ from one another in points too important to be called
details, though they agree in representing the Black Prince
as having remained in his position. The Chandos Herald,
whose testimony is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prim√¢ facie</i> deserving of the highest
respect, affirms that the prince had in the night made up his
mind to retreat, that he had sent off his vanguard to convey
the baggage across the stream, and would have followed with
his whole army, had not the French made haste to attack
the rear-guard. The discrepancy is obviously fundamental;<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>one side or the other must start from a total misconception,
and if so, it is hardly worth while to speculate as to what
rags of truth may be left in the narrative.</p>

<p>The Black Prince's army was as usual divided into three
parts, under the earl of Warwick, the prince himself, and
the earl of Salisbury. The numbers are disputed, the French
being naturally inclined to raise the total, the English to
diminish it. The authorities on the English side agree in
giving about 8000, and they obviously would have the best
means of knowing. A real element of uncertainty is, however,
always present, in the doubt whether the attendants on
the knights are to be added, or are meant to be included in
the number given of other soldiers besides the men-at-arms
and archers. Probably it would be safe to affirm that the
number did not exceed 10,000 of all arms. Having to fight a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>defensive action against very superior forces, the prince
necessarily resorted to tactics much like those of Crecy. The
earl of Warwick's division, comprising comparatively a large
proportion of archers, lined the hedge in front. Salisbury's
men-at-arms, dismounted, were drawn up in line, a stone's-throw
back from the gap in the hedge, with archers on their
flanks, who would naturally be thrown forwards. The
prince's own "battle" he moved<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> up on to a gentle eminence
on one flank; this was at the spot marked Bernon on the
map, and on the left flank, assuming Colonel Babinet to be
right in his identification of the position. From this point he
returned after the battle had begun, to sustain Warwick and
Salisbury, except that he throughout kept some hundreds of
men-at-arms mounted, in reserve.</p>

<p>The numbers on the French side are stated with much
greater discrepancy than on the English. Froissart gives
no less than 60,000, but there seems reason to believe that
the real amount was about 40,000, or fully four times the
Black Prince's total. A picked body of 500 horsemen, under
the two marshals Audrehen and Clermont, was to lead the
attack. This was followed by the first of the main "battles"
under the duke of Normandy, John's eldest son. The
second was commanded by his brother the duke of Orleans,
the third by the king in person; both of these remained
apparently at some distance. As the marshals advanced
up the funnel-shaped opening leading to the gap, which
was itself only wide enough for four horsemen abreast, the
archers, protected by the hedge, poured in volleys of
arrows. Thanks to their armour, the French were not all
shot down, and engaged in a hand-to-hand conflict with
Salisbury's men, ranked beyond the gap. The first French
line, as they followed, engaged with Warwick's troops along
the whole line of the hedge.</p>

<p>Seeing that many arrows were broken on the stout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>armour, or glanced from it, the earl of Oxford bade the
archers, who were closing round the flank and rear of the
mounted force, aim at the horses, which were less protected.
In this way the horsemen were soon routed; one marshal
was killed, the other taken prisoner, their immediate
command was nearly destroyed, and the whole first line
was driven back in confusion. The temptation to pursue
must have been strong: but the English leaders knew that
their work was only begun. They reformed their ranks,
and awaited a fresh attack, which was not long in coming.
The French second line under the duke of Orleans advanced
in its turn, and after a similar struggle was repulsed
even more completely. Still the English commanders
would not allow pursuit, though Sir Maurice Berkeley<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
charged on his own private account into the retreating
mass, and was, as might be expected, taken prisoner,
desperately wounded, after performing prodigies of valour.
The breathing time was spent in carrying back the wounded
into safety behind the hedges, and in gathering as many
arrows as possible, for the stock was running short. It
speaks volumes for the deadliness of the shooting at that
short range, that the chronicler speaks of the archers drawing
the arrows out of the bodies of the dead and wounded,
not picking them up from the ground. The French king,
on hearing that his son had been beaten back, swore
solemnly that he would not leave the field that day, unless
dead or a prisoner, and led on the third line. The
English, all of whom, except the prince's small reserve, had
now been fighting for hours against heavy odds, were
nearly worn out; a great many had been wounded, and
the numbers left seemed too small to withstand another
onset. At this juncture some dismay was caused by the
Captal de Buch, a Gascon noble who won a great reputation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>in the latter part of the war, riding off the field followed by
a handful of men-at-arms and a hundred archers. It was
naturally imagined that he was flying or deserting: instead
of this, he had obtained the prince's permission to make a
bold stroke for victory, by circling round the French flank
and attacking them in their left rear. This third conflict
was the severest of all, the more so as the archers, their
arrows being exhausted, had to resort to their bills. At
length the Captal de Buch was seen emerging from beyond
the slightly rising ground which had masked his movements
from the French, displaying the red cross of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George as
a signal: thereupon the Black Prince charged with his
reserve of mounted men-at-arms. The day was finally won:
though the king of France fought on desperately for awhile,
showing himself as good soldier as he was bad general, he
was at length obliged to surrender himself prisoner.</p>

<p>A long list of nobles and knights interred in the churches
of Poitiers, another long list of distinguished captives, mark
the overwhelming nature of the defeat which the French
had sustained. So great was the number of prisoners that
the Black Prince released a very large part, on their
undertaking to pay their ransom at Bordeaux. The
English loss must have been severe, relatively to the force
engaged, though no authoritative figures can be given. The
French of course lost much more heavily; but the mere
number of slain was as nothing compared to the crushing
effect of the unexpected blow. Had there been any spirit
of resistance left in the French, the Black Prince could
hardly have reached Bordeaux in safety. The relics of the
army defeated at Poitiers must have amounted to several
times his diminished force: yet he carried off his noble
prisoners, with all the spoil of the royal camp and of his
previous raid, without a trace of opposition.</p>

<p>It would almost seem as if Edward <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> and his son never
seriously contemplated the subjugation of France: for instead
of attempting to take advantage of the virtual dissolution
of all government resulting from the defeat of Poitiers
and the king's capture, the Black Prince returned to England
with his prisoner. The treaty of Bretigny, by which Edward
resigned his claims to the French crown, and the French
king abandoned all suzerainty over the south-west, was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>reasonable solution of the difficulty, if nothing had been at
stake but the personal pretensions of the two monarchs.
But the national feelings of the French were too strongly
roused: the treaty was never carried out. John's son and
successor Charles <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr>, or rather his military adviser the
Constable Duguesclin, learned wisdom from the crushing
defeats of Crecy and Poitiers, and steadily abstained from
confronting English armies in the field. All the arts of
minor warfare, raids, surprise of castles, cutting off of small
parties, were adopted against the English, and the success
though slow was steady, and was twofold. Outnumbered
from the nature of the case, the English could not but lose
in a war thus carried on; and the French subjects of the
Black Prince were alienated, through being exposed both to
injury at the hands of their own countrymen, and to heavy
demands on their resources made by the prince to help him
fight a losing game. Gradually things went more and more
against the English, until by the time the Black Prince's
health failed, and he went home to die, little was left beyond
a few towns, which were bound to England by commercial
ties. Nor was this all; in the second active stage of the
great war, when Henry <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr> was formally accepted as heir to
the French crown, the south-west was the region in which
the cause of the Dauphin, the national cause, was most
steadily supported.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>AGINCOURT AND ORLEANS</small></h2>


<p>For nearly forty years after the death of the Black Prince
the English pretensions against France lay dormant. Something
like friendly relations existed from time to time between
the two countries: Richard <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> even contracted a
marriage with a French princess, though he was deposed
before his child bride was grown up. Cordial peace however
was impossible: the English possessions in Guienne
were a standing temptation to French ambition and patriotism:
the English claim to the French crown was a standing
provocation. That claim had by no means been forgotten:
the glories of Crecy and Poitiers had made a deeper impression
than the slow failure of the following years, the
burden of which had fallen much more heavily on Guienne
than on England. To the English mind the pretensions of
their kings to the throne of France had become a national
rather than a personal matter. It was England that considered
herself entitled to dominate over France, rather than
an individual claiming an inheritance for himself. Richard
<abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> had been succeeded by his cousin the duke of Lancaster,
who reigned by a perfectly valid national title, formally
voted by Parliament, and substantially accepted by the
country as a whole. He was, as it happened, the heir male
of Edward <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>, heir according to the theory embodied in
the Salic law which France had made her rule of succession:
but he was not the heir of Edward <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> according to the
theory which alone could render valid Edward <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>'s claim
to France. What is commonly said in relation to Edward
is strictly true of Henry <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr>: if his contention was based on
a sound theory, it held good in favour of some one else.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>There is no trace of this being recognised in England:
Henry <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr> was the lawful king of England, lawful successor
of his great-grandfather, and might reasonably urge his
great-grandfather's pretensions.</p>

<p>The state of France at the date of the accession of
Henry <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr> was deplorable. The king, Charles <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr>, had
long been mad; his occasional lucid intervals, when he was
supposed to resume the reins of government, only served
to make confusion worse. The queen was one of the worst
of women, without the great abilities which went some way
towards atoning for the wickedness of Catharine de Medicis
or her namesake of Russia. The Dauphin was a dissolute
and reckless boy. All good government was lost: for
power was disputed by two bitterly hostile factions, each
of which used it in turn for its own purposes. One was
headed by the duke of Burgundy, cousin of the king, son
of the boy who was taken prisoner at Poitiers beside his
father king John. The other, which bore the name of
Armagnacs,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> was headed by the young duke of Orleans,
the king's nephew, between whom and John of Burgundy
there was an irreconcilable blood-feud. The statesmanship
of France was not ill-represented by the Dauphin's insult
to Henry <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr>, in sending him a present of balls at his
accession, with a message implying that he deemed the
young king, perhaps the ablest man of his age, little better
than a child. Shakespeare makes much of the story that
the archbishop of Canterbury urged Henry to undertake
war with France, in order to divert his attention from
ecclesiastical affairs at home. Whatever weight this may
have had, the opportunity was obvious, and Henry was very
well competent to use it.</p>

<p>In August 1415 Henry <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr> landed at the mouth of the
Seine, with a well-equipped army of about 30,000 men.
No better point for an invasion could be chosen: there was
a good harbour for his base, and almost the shortest distance
from the sea-shore to Paris is straight up the Seine.
Before however he could advance Harfleur must be taken,
and this cost an unexpectedly long time. More than a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>month elapsed before the town surrendered; and then it
is suggested that dysentery, which was raging alike inside
and outside the walls, was largely answerable for the surrender.
The siege was conducted entirely by battering,
like a siege of three or four centuries later: probably the
comparative slowness and inadequacy of the cannonade
was more or less balanced by the inferiority of the defensive
works to those of later times. When the town had fallen
(or was on the point of falling, for the date is not quite
certain), Henry sent a message to the Dauphin, offering
to settle the dispute by single combat with him, as his
father was incapacitated. The proposal is altogether in the
style of chivalry, and was doubtless considered the right
and proper thing to do: but seeing that the Dauphin was
a weak and debauched lad, and Henry in the very prime
of vigour, there was nothing really high-minded about it.
Henry deemed himself bound to wait for an answer, and
during the interval resolved on his course of action. His
army had been frightfully reduced by illness as well as by
the losses in the siege: we are told that 5000 men had to
be sent home invalided, besides the large number who died.
A garrison was also wanted for Harfleur; altogether the
king could not move with above a third of his original
force. The accounts given from the English side, which are
numerous and unusually circumstantial, vary only slightly:
and one French writer, who expressly says that he saw the
English army, agrees pretty closely with them. French
writers in general had only hearsay to guide them, and had
every motive to exaggerate the English numbers. Of men-at-arms
Henry had left from 800 to 1000, of archers five
or six thousand, besides other foot-soldiers who were probably
about half as numerous. Whatever the number was,
it had suffered no material change before the battle of
Agincourt.</p>

<p>With such an insignificant force, offensive operations
were out of the question. Prudence obviously suggested,
while honour forbade, a direct return to England. Henry
determined to march through the coast districts of Normandy,
and so gain Calais. Doubtless he was encouraged
to take this venturous course by his knowledge of the
distracted state of France, and in particular by the fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>that, while he had now been six weeks in the country, no
attempt had been made to disturb him, though there was
by this time a hostile army gathering at Rouen. About
October 8 the English army started, carrying with them
provisions for several days, with no waggons to delay their
march, and under strict orders that there should be no
plundering. Henry aimed at crossing the Somme as his
great-grandfather had done, by the ford of Blanchetaque
below Abbeville: but on coming within a few miles he was
informed that it was very strongly held by the enemy.
One French writer says that this information was false, and
that it was the cause of the subsequent disaster, as otherwise
Henry would have reached Calais without fighting.
True or false, Henry believed it, and marched up the
Somme, finding bridge after bridge broken, and naturally
feeling that the chance of a French army barring the road
was hourly increasing. At length, on October 18, fords
were found near Nesle, and the English made their way
safely across. Two days later Henry received a message
from the dukes of Orleans and Bourbon to the effect that
they proposed to fight him before he reached Calais, and
asking him to appoint a meeting-place. Henry's reply was
that of a general, not of a knight-errant: he was marching
straight to Calais, and they might meet him where they
pleased.</p>

<p>The proceedings of the French as reported are somewhat
difficult to interpret. We are told, and there is no reason
to disbelieve it, that D'Albret, the Constable of France,
had been against attempting to relieve Harfleur: the tradition
of the great defeats at Crecy and Poitiers, and of the
success which had attended the subsequent policy of not
fighting in the open field, might well account for this. For
the same reason, doubtless, the army under his command
was withdrawn behind the Somme on the news of Henry's
march having begun, though why the river was not better
guarded it is difficult to imagine. On the other hand we
are told that the king of France came to Rouen with the
Dauphin, after the fall of Harfleur, and that all the chief
nobility of France came thither at his summons. So
numerous were their forces, and so confident were they,
that they refused the offer of a contingent from the city of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>Paris of 6000 men, one of them saying, "What do we
want of the assistance of these shopkeepers, since we are
three times as many as the English?" Most of these nobles
must have marched with the Constable: it can only have
been from his army that the challenge to Henry, above
referred to, can possibly have been sent. Then an unintelligible
story is told, of a royal council having been held
at Rouen on October 20 (this date is clearly impossible),
at which it was decided to fight a battle, and orders were
sent accordingly to the Constable. But the same account
goes on to speak of summons for all who were fit to bear
arms to join the Constable's army, which from the nature
of the case would have fought and (as was assumed) destroyed
the English, long before any fresh troops could
reinforce what was already far larger than necessary. Then
follows a statement that an invitation was sent to the duke
of Burgundy's son, who was only prevented from joining by
his father's express orders, and that he never to his dying
day forgot the humiliation of being kept away from the
battle. Seeing that the youth in question was afterwards
duke Philip called the Good, whose co-operation with
Henry <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr> put France, officially speaking, into the hands of
the latter, it is scarcely possible to accept this as true.
Equally out of keeping with the prevalent feeling of the
French at the time is the story that the king and the
Dauphin wanted to join the army, and were prevented by
the old duke of Berri, the king's uncle, who said, remembering
Poitiers, "Better lose the battle than the king and
the battle too." Why, if there was anything of an army in
Normandy, and the council at Rouen were so bent on a
battle, no attempt was made to harass Henry's march, when
the Constable was ready to stop him in front, does not
appear. From the English accounts, one of which was
written by Henry's own attendant chaplain, it is perfectly
certain that their march was nowhere really impeded by
encountering enemies. The whole conduct of the French,
alike in strategy and in the tactics of the actual battle of
Agincourt, was ill judged: the explanation doubtless being
that the great nobles could not be controlled effectually by
the Constable.</p>

<p>When Henry crossed the Somme, the French army was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>apparently at Bapaume, twenty miles to the northward. Why
they made no attempt to attack the English, who marched
past them in a line parallel to the river, but a few miles to
the north-east of it, can hardly be conjectured. At any
moment, during two or three days, the Constable might
have fallen upon them, and the English if defeated must
have been destroyed, for the Somme would have been at
their back. Perhaps the Constable thought it wiser to let
Henry go to Calais unimpeded, and only moved in
deference to positive orders from the king. Whatever the
reason, it was not till Henry was passing him that he
moved: then he marched in the same direction, the two
routes gradually converging towards each other. On
October 24, just after crossing the little river Ternoise,
called in the English narratives the river of swords, Henry
came almost into collision with the French, whose swarming
bands covered the country on his right, and almost in front.
The French halted, as if to tempt him to attack. Henry
knew better than so to throw away his best chance: having
the advantage of the ground, he halted and formed his line
for battle. The general feeling in the English army, if one
may trust Henry's chaplain, was one of deep despondency.
Nor was this unreasonable, seeing that they must cut
their way through an army several times the size of their
own, unless the enemy threw away his advantage. The
king alone was cool and confident. When Sir Walter
Hungerford in his hearing uttered a wish for 10,000
more archers, Henry uttered the famous rebuke which
Shakespeare<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> has immortalised.</p>

<p class="mt2">The Constable, seeing that he could not attack the
English to advantage, continued his march for a mile or so,
and halted across the road by which the English must
march to Calais, between the little villages of Agincourt
and Tramecourt, the English camping almost where they
had halted to offer battle, in and about Maisoncelles.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>There was much rain in the night, to the great discomfort
of the English, who had little shelter, and had had more
than a fortnight of continuous and fairly hard marching,
with rather scanty supplies of food. The rain proved in
truth a valuable ally, when the French assailed them next
day over the soft wet ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="i_b_086"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_086.jpg" width="600" height="457" alt="Map VI: Battle of Agincourt." />
</div>

<p>Early on the 25th Henry arrayed his little army in order
of battle. In accordance with custom, the vanguard for
marching purposes formed the right of the line, the rearguard
the left: the former was commanded by the duke of
York, the latter by lord Camoys, the king himself taking
charge of the main body in the centre: the total number
was too small to admit of a reserve. Accounts differ as
to the exact formation adopted, though there is perfect
unanimity as to the English men-at-arms having all dismounted,
and left their horses in rear with the baggage,
such as there was. Nor is there any doubt that the archers
carried each man a six-foot stake, to plant in the ground
in front of the line, so as to form a sort of palisade. These
stakes we are expressly told had been cut by Henry's order
immediately before crossing the Somme, when he knew that
an attack from superior numbers was at any time possible.
It seems to have been his own idea, and to have become the
regular practice after Agincourt. Some writers state that
the archers were entirely on the flanks, so that when the
line had advanced to where it came into collision with the
French, the archers lined the woods on each side of the
open ground, which was crossed by the dismounted men-at-arms.
This view however must be rejected for more
reasons than one. The distance from the wood skirting
Tramecourt on the English right to that skirting Agincourt
on the left was over half-a-mile.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> This is too great a
distance to be covered by arrows from the sides, even with
the long-bow at its best, and it is certain that the arrows
did deadly execution all over the battle-field. Moreover
Henry had at the most only 1000 men-at-arms, probably
under 900. This number in single rank would hardly
suffice to cover half-a-mile, and of course they could not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>in single rank: there is no reason to doubt what is stated
by every authority who mentions the point at all, that they
were four deep. It is necessary therefore to adopt the
other view, that each of the three divisions had its separate
formation, dismounted men-at-arms in line in the centre,
and the archers on each flank of them. The archers were
formed in wedges (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cuneos</i>), says Henry's chaplain. The
formation already described in giving account of Crecy was
no doubt by this time the regularly established one for an
English line: its merits were obvious, and well tested.
The differences between Crecy and Agincourt were only
that in the latter case the front was in three divisions
instead of two, and the archers were protected by an
improvised palisade, besides being separated by shorter
lines of spearmen. These differences would obviously all
tend to make them more destructive.</p>

<p>The numbers of the French army are told so variously
that it is impossible to state them with any confidence.
They are usually given by comparison with the English, and
the proportion varies from six times as great down to three
times. Henry had perhaps about 10,000 in all, as has been
stated above; he may well have had less, but cannot have
had more.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The French were drawn up in three divisions,
one behind the other, each having a continuous line of dismounted
men-at-arms. One contemporary, who says that
the English were four deep, says that the French were thirty
deep, which may possibly have been true of the men-at-arms,
who formed a much larger proportion of the French
army than of the English. The front line, at any rate,
cannot have had more than 600 in front at the outside, for
a small body of horsemen was placed on each flank to
charge the English archers, and the whole space available
was but half-a-mile, though it is true that they were much
crowded together. There were archers, or at any rate cross-bowmen,
in the French army: how they were posted does
not appear, except that they were never given a chance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>being useful. The knights, we are told, refused to let them
have the post of honour in front, behaving thus with the
usual feudal vaingloriousness, which had cost the French so
dear at Crecy. Similarly we are told that the French had
cannon, but certainly no use was made of them, perhaps for
the same reason.</p>

<p>The highest nobility of France was well represented on
the battle-field: in fact there were so many semi-royal
personages that it was a difficult task for the Constable,
whose authority they barely recognised, to distribute the
honour of command so as to satisfy them. Ultimately the
first division, which was to have the brunt of the fighting,
and expected to carry off all the glory, comprised (it would
be a farce to say it was commanded by) the Constable, the
Marshal, the dukes of Orleans and Bourbon, the brother of
the duke of Brittany, and the count of Eu. The second
division had at its head the dukes of Alen√ßon and Bar, the
count of Nevers, youngest brother of the duke of Burgundy,
and the count of Vaudemont, brother of the duke of Lorraine.
The rear division was under men of less note: some or
all of the men-at-arms belonging to it remained on horseback.
The front line of the French was drawn up a little north of
the cross-road which now (and possibly then) leads from
Agincourt to Tramecourt. Here they were on rising ground,
and had a wider space than further to the south, the woods
which bound the ground which was the actual scene of
conflict trending back a little on each side. Consequently
when the French advanced, the men were crowded more
together. We cannot be wrong in assuming that the taking
up of this position was the Constable's doing, as he had
throughout been averse to attacking the English in the field:
they had but to hold it, and Henry must attack, with everything
against him. If the French authorities are correct,
Henry so fully recognised this that he tried to negotiate,
but the terms offered were such as he declined to accept.
This is not improbable in itself, though the English writers
do not mention it: and it is all the more likely to be true,
as the battle did not begin till some three hours after
sunrise.</p>

<p>Less than a mile separated the two armies, over ploughed
land, gently rising towards the French, and soft with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>recent rain, the upper part at least doubtless already trodden
into mire by the French, who had been stationary thereabouts
since the previous afternoon. There was no alternative
but to advance, as the French did not: but Henry
possessed in his archers a means of stinging them into action,
and the class pride of the French nobles had led to the
adoption of an order of battle which gave them no means
of replying. Towards ten o'clock the king gave the word,
"In the name of Almighty God and of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George, advance
banners." For a moment, the English line knelt and touched
the earth with their faces: then with a cheer they moved
forward. As soon as they were within bowshot of the
enemy the line halted, the archers fixed their stakes in the
soft ground and began to shoot. Obviously the French
could not stand to be riddled with arrows: the horsemen
who had been placed on the flanks of the front line on
purpose to "over-ride" the archers, were ordered to charge,
but were unable even to reach the English and were driven
back in confusion. The Constable now led the men-at-arms
forwards, separating them apparently into three masses, to
attack the three lines of English spearmen. Weighted with
armour, they sank to the calf at each step, and the archers
took them more and more in flank as they advanced. Still,
they managed to reach and even to press back the English
men-at-arms: but then the archers, taking to their bills,
quitted the protection of the stakes, and closed on to the
flanks of the helpless struggling mass, who were far too
closely wedged together to use their spears. The Constable
was killed: all the other noble personages figure on the list
of prisoners: of one of them, the duke of Orleans, it is
expressly said that he was taken out after the battle from a
pile of dead and wounded; and probably the same fate
befell others. Wounded or not, they could not move to
escape from the ghastly heap, sunk deeper and deeper in
the struggle into the miry soil. Pushing a little forward,
Henry attacked the second French line, doubtless in the
same manner, and with equally decisive result. The
slaughter of the second division was presumably even
greater, for all its leaders, with the duke of Brabant, who
arrived with reinforcements during the battle, were found
among the slain. Most of the third line fled without resistance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the counts at its head made a last desperate charge
at the head of a few hundred men, and found the death
they expected.</p>

<p>The battle was now won, and the English had time to
secure the prisoners. Suddenly a body of French fugitives
who had rallied, threatened a fresh attack: how many there
were is not stated, but the total number of fugitives was two
or three times as great as the whole English army. It was
impossible to guard the prisoners while repelling the attack,
and a slaughter of them had begun, when the enemy withdrew.
Of the total French loss the estimates vary greatly:
the names of the most important nobles who fell have been
given already. It is perhaps worth mention that the grandfathers
of two of them perished at Crecy, the then count of
Alen√ßon, and the then duke of Lorraine. Between slain and
prisoners, the French nobility suffered enormously; in fact
the blow to the Armagnac party was for the time crushing,
though it may be doubted whether the loss was not a disguised
gain to France, as leaving room for the far more
competent professional soldiers, who conducted the last
stages of the great war.</p>

<p>On the English side king Henry fought like the meanest
soldier, with his own hand saving the life of his young
brother Humphrey. His helmet still hangs in Westminster
Abbey, with more than one dent from a sword-stroke,
doubtless received in the great battle. The list of English
slain is preposterously small; just thirteen men-at-arms,
though among them was included the duke of York, last
surviving grandson of Edward <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>, and about a hundred
others. One need realise very fully the conditions of the
battle, the absurd mismanagement of the French leaders,
and the helplessness of their masses, not to multiply
tenfold the numbers given, which nevertheless are
authentic.</p>

<p>An illustration of the imminence of the danger from which
the English escaped, is furnished by the fact that during the
action the baggage was plundered by French stragglers. As
the army left Harfleur without a waggon, with nothing but
what could be carried on horses or by the soldiers themselves,
there cannot have been much: but the king lost some
articles of plate and jewellery for his own personal use,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>including the seals of his chancery, which however were
most of them recovered afterwards through the instrumentality
of a French noble who had been taken prisoner in
Harfleur. Henry's crown he wore fixed on his helmet, and
a portion of it was cut away in the battle.</p>

<p>Henry <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr> was too wise to imagine that his small force,
even after victory, could achieve great things. He returned
in triumph to England, leaving the French factions to tear
the country to pieces. In 1417 he landed again in Normandy,
and set to work systematically to conquer that
province, which was left to defend itself, while the princes
pursued the much more interesting employment of quarrelling
with each other. After capturing Rouen, and organising
the government so thoroughly that Normandy remained in
English hands for thirty years, Henry marched on Paris. In
face of this pressing danger the French factions began to
negotiate, and an interview was arranged on the bridge of
Montereau: but the Armagnacs seized the opportunity
treacherously to murder the duke of Burgundy in the
presence of the Dauphin. Naturally his son at once went
over to Henry's side. The Dauphin was entirely in the
hands of the Armagnacs, who were as incapable as they
were base. In Paris, which was always inclined to the
Burgundian side, the feeling spread that Henry of England,
especially if he married a French princess as he proposed to
do, would be better than the Dauphin. In a few months
the treaty of Troyes was agreed to, by which Henry was to
be regent during the lifetime of Charles <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr>, and succeed
to the throne on his death, on condition of his marrying the
princess Catharine. Unfortunately Henry died two years
later, just before Charles <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> The infant Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> was
proclaimed king of both countries, and his uncle Bedford
ruled vigorously in his name. The death of Charles <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr>
however made the Dauphin no longer a quasi-rebel, but the
legitimate king: and the national feeling of France declared
for him. Roughly speaking, the English ruled all north of
the Loire, thanks to the Burgundian alliance; the south
more or less ruled itself, for Charles <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr> was indolent and
unwarlike. His cause was not without support in the north,
while his Scottish allies were there, but two bloody defeats
at Crevant and Verneuil inflicted enormous loss on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>Scots. In the latter battle the archers played a very conspicuous
part: we find some of the archers, left to guard the
horses and baggage while the men-at-arms fought on foot,
beating off unaided the body of French horse which had
been sent round to attack the English rear. Though no
more fighting on a large scale took place, it was not till 1428
that Bedford saw his way to the definite forward step of
besieging Orleans.</p>

<p>This city is usually spoken of as being of paramount importance,
the "key of the south"; it is assumed that its
capture would have been equivalent to the final overthrow
of Charles <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr> A glance at the map will show that,
although the possession of Orleans would have been an
undoubted advantage to the English, it would have only
been one step towards the conquest of the southern half of
France. It might with more justice be asserted that until
Orleans was taken, the English were far from secure in their
hold on the north. However this may be, the siege of
Orleans did in fact witness the first English failure. One of
the most remarkable characters in history appeared quite
suddenly on the scene, and turned the scale against them.</p>

<p>Orleans stands on the north bank of the Loire, with a
long bridge connecting it with the south bank. At the time
of the siege the inhabitants destroyed the suburb on the
south bank, retaining only a fort commanding the bridge-head,
called the Tournelles, which they covered with a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boulevard</i>.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The English under the earl of Salisbury
began the siege on October 12, 1428. Their camp was
pitched on the south of the Loire, and the first operation
was to construct a little fort on the ruins of the Augustin
convent, whence their cannon were directed mainly at the
Tournelles. A mine was run from thence under the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boulevard</i>
in front of the Tournelles. For some mysterious reason
the English did not wait to fire the mine, but assaulted the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boulevard</i>, and were repulsed. This waste of life might well
have been spared, for the French not only abandoned the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>outwork, but, the Tournelles being injured by the cannonade,
evacuated that also after offering almost nominal resistance
to an assault. The French broke down an arch of the
bridge next to the Tournelles, and proceeded to construct a
new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boulevard</i> on a small islet near the south bank of the
Loire, over which the bridge passed. So far the siege had
progressed successfully and rapidly: but on October 27
Salisbury was mortally wounded by a cannon-shot from the
city, while reconnoitring from the top of the Tournelles.
The death of so experienced a soldier was a great blow to
the besiegers: but his successor Suffolk carried on the work
with energy. Bringing the army over to the right bank, he
left Sir William Glansdale in command of the Tournelles
and the other forts on the left bank. His purpose was to
complete the investment by a series of small forts all round
the city; but the weather delayed his operations, and it was
not till the end of the year that the city was actually invested.
Even then it was not impossible to run the gauntlet
of the forts, or to steal into the city by the river: scarcity
however began to be severely felt. In February 1429 a
relieving force, attempting to destroy a convoy of provisions
on its way to the English camp, was totally routed on the
"Day of the Herrings," so called because a large part of the
provisions consisted of salt herrings (Lent was just beginning).
Sir John Fastolfe, who commanded, and who had a
force partly English, partly French of the Burgundian party,
had time to form his waggons in square,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> within which extemporised
fort his men stood on the defensive, the English
archers guarding one of the issues, the French spearmen the
other. The attack was begun by a body of picked men who
had come out of Orleans, and who had cannon with them.
Obviously Fastolfe's defence could not long have been
maintained against even the inefficient cannonading of that
age: but the vanguard of the relieving army came up in
time to save the day to the English. Throwing themselves
from their horses, in obedience to the unreasoning superstition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
which had cost the French so dear on greater fields,
they rushed at Fastolfe's <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">lager</i>. The Scots were shot
down by the archers, the Gascons impaled themselves on
the spears: when the rout was complete, the little English
army issuing from behind their waggons slaughtered as they
pleased. Such a disaster was calculated to drive the men of
Orleans to despair. As a last chance they offered their city
to the duke of Burgundy, who naturally would much have
liked such an addition to his dominions: as naturally, the
English would not listen to the proposal for a moment.
One of the regent's council said in the duke's presence that
the English were not made to chew morsels for the duke of
Burgundy to swallow. Bedford himself put the same point
with less vulgarity, but equal force, saying that he was not
going to beat the bushes, for some one else to catch the
birds. Burgundy had no answer to make: he was not yet
prepared to break with the English, though this disappointment
helped no doubt to increase the growing coolness
between him and Bedford. Orleans had no prospect before
it but starvation or surrender, when its doom was averted
by a miracle.</p>

<p>The deliverer who appeared at this critical moment was
Jeanne d'Arc, a peasant girl from Lorraine. Her imagination
had been deeply impressed by the miseries of the war:
for years she had heard voices, as she called them, telling
her that she was to save France, and gradually becoming
more frequent and more specific in their commands. At
length her profound enthusiasm made such an impression
on her neighbours that she was able to make her way to
the young king, to whom she announced herself as sent by
God to deliver France, and conduct him to Rheims for his
coronation. Charles was naturally inclined to be incredulous,
but she convinced him of her good faith, and won so
great an influence over courtiers and soldiers alike, as to
put down for the time the prevalent profligacy and irreligion.
We are told that the roughest of the French soldiers of
fortune, notorious for bad language, accustomed himself, to
please the Maid, to swearing only <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par mon b√¢ton</i>.</p>

<p>The immediate and pressing business was to save Orleans.
Clad in armour, Jeanne accompanied a force which obeyed
her inspiration, though it could hardly be said to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>under her orders, to convey provisions from Tours. In her
simple faith she wished to attack the besiegers in the most
direct way; but the leaders, thinking it safer to set about
their difficult task in the fashion most likely to succeed,
brought her opposite Orleans on the south side of the
Loire. She was indignant at the deception, but the incident
only served to increase her influence. The intention was to
send the provisions into Orleans by large boats, which were
to be sent up the river to a convenient spot, and run the
gauntlet of the besiegers back again, under cover of an
attack from the relieving force. The wind however blew
down stream, and the boats could not move against both
wind and current. Jeanne however confidently declared
that the wind would change, as it in fact did, and she
herself entered Orleans. Nothing was so far gained but
the immediate relief of urgent need: but in this case the
first step was emphatically everything. The French were
roused to confident enthusiasm by the belief that the Maid
was their divinely-appointed deliverer, the English were
correspondingly depressed. The consciousness of superiority,
that mysterious but very real feeling which often plays
a great part in war, changed sides. "Before the Maid
arrived," said Dunois, one of the bravest of the French
leaders, "200 English would put to flight, in a skirmish,
800 or 1000 of the king's army: after she came, 200 French
engaged all the strength of the English, and forced them to
shut themselves up in their forts." This was an exaggeration,
but no more. One by one the English <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bastides</i> were assailed,
and fell into the hands of the French. Sometimes the
defence was but feeble, sometimes it was for the time
successful. The truth was that the English superiority was
due to their tactics in the field, for which there was obviously
no place in the attack and defence of fortifications, not to
greater courage, except so far as repeated defeats had cowed
the French and led them to expect failure. Jeanne d'Arc
had changed all that: her own perfect courage, and calm
conviction that she was under the guidance of Heaven,
roused her excitable countrymen to irresistible enthusiasm.
At length came the turn of the Tournelles: the relieving
army, with the Maid at their head, assaulted the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boulevard</i>
which protected the little fort on the south. The English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>defended themselves desperately, and for three hours kept
the enemy at bay. Jeanne was wounded by an arrow, and
this caused such general discouragement that the leaders of
the French were on the point of retreating. The Maid
herself however had not lost heart; "See," she cried
suddenly, "my banner touches the wall, the place is yours,"
and returned to the assault. Roused to madness by her
example, the French renewed the conflict, some of them
shouting that they could see <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael in the air beckoning
them on, others that they saw the white dove of the
Holy Spirit alight on the Maid's standard. Some of the
garrison of Orleans pushed planks across the broken arch
of the bridge, and took the Tournelles in rear. The
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boulevard</i> was carried, and as Glansdale the commander
was retiring into the Tournelles, a cannon-ball broke the
bridge of communication, and he was drowned in the ditch.
With his death all resistance ceased: the relics of the
garrison of the Tournelles were taken prisoners. The besiegers,
seeing that the game was finally lost, abandoned the
siege.</p>

<p>Apart from the personal interest awakened by the first
exploits of Jeanne d'Arc, who is a character unique in
history, the siege of Orleans has some military interest. In
it we see the medi√¶val and the modern<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> conditions of a
siege more or less combined. Cannon are employed on
both sides, and at first with some effect; the English capture
of the Tournelles is due to the damage done by their fire:
Salisbury could have been killed from the town by no other
means. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bastides</i> erected by the besiegers are in medi√¶val
style, belonging to a state of things when walled towns
had to be starved out: it does not seem to have been
regarded as possible to batter Orleans itself. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boulevard</i>
of the Tournelles on the other hand is modern, an outwork
formed expressly for the use of cannon. The hand-to-hand
fighting of the assaults is of all ages, down to very recent
times. Whether, in face of all the engines of destruction
that can now be brought into play, a storm like that of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>Tournelles, or even like that of Badajos, will ever be possible
again, is another question.</p>

<p>The failure of the siege of Orleans marks the beginning
of the decline of English power in France. Jeanne d'Arc
is reasonably called a saint and a heroine: her career, brief
and ultimately disastrous as it was, had a great immediate
effect in stimulating French patriotism generally, and especially
in rousing Charles <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr> to a sense of his duty. But it
is entirely a mistake to rank her first and greatest exploit as
an event of supreme importance.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> One may see any day
on the sea-shore the tide at its height lapping round the
base of a bit of rock which it never entirely covers: but
one does not therefore suppose that the rock caused the
turn of the tide. The nominal submission of France to
Henry <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr> at the treaty of Troyes had been due to France
being divided against herself, to one party being so bitter
against the other as to be willing to league with the foreigner.
The superiority of Henry, and of his brother the regent
Bedford, to any of their immediate opponents, was most
marked; the excellence of the English soldiers and tactics
gave them every advantage. Yet even so they could not
conquer France. Such a state of things could not last;
competent soldiers, rulers who were not slaves of faction,
were sure to emerge sooner or later. The duke of Burgundy
had only to change sides, which as a matter of fact he did
out of personal grudge against Bedford, to weight the scale
heavily. The ultimate failure of the English attempt to
conquer France was inevitable: whether the process of expelling
them should be long or short must needs depend on
the amount of capacity shown on each side.</p>

<p>The superstitious awe inspired by Jeanne d'Arc did not
last long; in that age all the world was ready to believe in
her having supernatural powers, but these might as easily
be diabolical as divine. Naturally the French regarded her
at first as divinely inspired; and her piety, honesty, and
perfect simplicity, which were conspicuous to them, might
well have roused a more lasting enthusiasm. The English
as naturally regarded her as a witch, and put her to a cruel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>death as such when she fell into their hands. The victory
of Patay, won by the French during the period of her influence,
was due mainly to the English commander being attacked
before he had time to form his line, though to Jeanne may
doubtless be ascribed the unusual promptness of the French in
attacking. The Maid fulfilled her word, and had Charles <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr>
crowned in Rheims: but otherwise the war dragged on
indecisively till the regent Bedford died, just when the duke
of Burgundy had found it worth his while to go over to the
French side. Thenceforward the English had no competent
head in France: the government at home was weak and
torn by dissensions, which led to the claims of the duke of
York. Nevertheless the war lasted nearly twenty years
longer, steadily tending in one direction, but marked by
only one notable event. This was the battle of Formigny in
1451, which was the final blow to the English power in
Normandy. Formigny was lost because the English leaders
applied the tactics which had won Crecy and Agincourt
under conditions to which they were not applicable. They
took up a defensive position, and stood to await attack, when
their business was to force their way onwards. The French
had a couple of cannon, and the English broke their lines to
try and seize them. They nearly succeeded, but the result
was that the two armies engaged in a hand-to-hand conflict,
in which the archers could not use their bows. Another
French force coming up and falling on the rear of the
English completed their destruction: of the 5000 men
engaged, 3700 were counted dead on the field.</p>

<p>That England gained anything by the Hundred Years'
War, except military repute, no one would dream of affirming:
even that was evanescent, for gunpowder presently drove
the bow out of use. France gained, at a frightful cost of
suffering, her national coherence, but she gained it in the
disastrous form of a monarchy virtually absolute. The war
almost destroyed the feudal nobility, and left nothing strong
but the crown. What might have been the history of
France if she had not gone through this fiery trial, if the
nobles had remained petty princes as in Germany, can
hardly be conjectured; the Hundred Years' War fixed the
destiny of France for her. The political lessons of the war
are glaringly obvious. A nation in the modern sense is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>indefinitely stronger than a feudal kingdom: conquest of
a people that chooses to resist persistently and with judgment
is impossible. The military lessons are equally clear:
discipline will counterbalance almost any odds: the chief
means of tactical success lies in the skilful combination of
different arms.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>THE WARS OF THE ROSES</small></h2>


<p>The Wars of the Roses were in more ways than one the
outcome of the great French war. Formally they were an
appeal to arms to decide a disputed succession to the crown:
substantially they were a revolt against a weak and discredited
government, of whose incompetence the unsuccessful
conduct of the war in France had been the most conspicuous
evidence. Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr>, or those who bore rule in his name,
had neither the sagacity to make peace and save some
portion of the French territory at the price of abandoning
claim to the whole, nor the energy to carry on the conflict
vigorously. The absurdly scanty numbers of the English
troops in France during the last fifteen or twenty years of
the war testify alike to the feebleness of the government at
home, and to the respect which English military skill and
prowess inspired abroad. The marriage of Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> was
arranged in the hope of propping up his failing cause in
France. And the personality of Margaret of Anjou is on
the whole the most important in the Wars of the Roses. On
the one hand her energy and daring alone sustained the
cause of Lancaster, which without her would have collapsed;
on the other hand her extreme unpopularity helped the
cause of York. The accident that she was eight years a
wife before becoming a mother contributed to the same end.
The duke of York had so long been in the position of next
in succession to the crown,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> that when a direct heir was born
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>to Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> the disappointed partisans of York began to say
that in strict hereditary right he ought to take precedence of
the boy. They could not bear to see the predominance of
the hated French queen assured, and her offspring barring
for ever the hopes of their leader and themselves. This was
perfectly natural under the circumstances, but it does not
therefore follow that the claim of York was sound. Those
disaffected to an actual king naturally look for a rival
claimant, the support of whom may serve to disguise
rebellion. There can be no doubt that, on the principles of
succession now legally established, the next heir to Richard <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>
was the young earl of March, or that his claim passed
eventually to the duke of York. On the other hand it is
equally certain that in the fifteenth century there was no
established law of succession, and that the substitution of
Henry of Lancaster for his cousin was in accordance with
the traditional rule of election. If Henry <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr> had lived to
old age, nothing would ever have been heard of the pretensions
of the house of York. Those pretensions were in
accordance with the legitimist ideas which were then gaining
ground elsewhere, as the natural corollary of absolutism,
but which have never been really accepted in England except
by Jacobite fanatics.</p>

<p>When the war at length broke out, ample material for the
armies was supplied by the soldiers whose occupation in
France was gone, by the overplus of a population not industrially
prospering, and most of all by the personal following of
the nobles. Though on the whole the cause of York was
favoured by the towns, by the merchants, by the most
prosperous and civilised elements of the nation, while the
backward regions of the north and west supported Lancaster,
yet the differences were not deep enough to affect
the conduct of the war. Both sides were equipped and
fought after the same fashion; both used cannon more or
less; both knew the deadly effect of the cloth-yard arrow,
and therefore sought to come to close quarters; both fought
with the obstinacy of their race, and often with the special
fury which civil war is apt to engender. Hence there is
much similarity between the battles, and not much interest,
in spite of the remarkable vicissitudes of fortune, except in
the three great battles won by Edward <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr> in person. To
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>what extent Edward deserves the credit of Towton, the first
and greatest of them, cannot be determined; he had the
co-operation of the earl of Warwick, and he was still very
young. Barnet and Tewkesbury were clearly his own.</p>

<p>Late in 1460, as the result of a Yorkist victory at Northampton,
a compromise was arranged by which Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr>
was to retain the crown for his life, and Richard duke of
York was recognised as his successor. Queen Margaret,
however, would not surrender the rights of her son without
a struggle: the nobles of the north rose in arms again, and
the duke of York was obliged to march against them. On
December 30 he was defeated and slain at Wakefield; his
second son, and his brother-in-law the earl of Salisbury,
Warwick's father, perished with him. The victory cost the
Lancastrians dear: the barbarity of decapitating York's
dead body, and placing the head, crowned in mockery with
a paper diadem, over the gate of York, strengthened the
feeling of hatred and contempt for the north-countrymen,
as little better than savages, already growing in the south.
Moreover, York, who had displayed no particular capacity,
was replaced by his son Edward, who, with all his faults,
proved the best soldier of the war. Warwick also, who was
an abler man than his father, and who already held the
great inheritance of the Beauchamps through marriage with
the heiress, succeeded to his father's wide domains, and so
concentrated in his own hands by far the greatest independent
power ever possessed by an English subject.
Margaret advanced southwards, won a battle at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Albans,
but found London unassailable, and was obliged to return
to Yorkshire, her soldiers plundering and destroying on the
way in a manner ruinous to her cause. Meanwhile the
young duke of York, after crushing the Lancastrians of the
Welsh border at Mortimer's Cross, had reached London, and
had been proclaimed king as Edward <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr> Without delay
he and Warwick marched northwards to bring the contest
to a decisive issue, and fought on Palm Sunday 1461 the
greatest battle, in respect of the numbers engaged, ever
fought on English soil.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>The great north road, dating back to Roman times,
crosses the river Aire at Ferrybridge, and the Wharfe at
Tadcaster, twelve or thirteen miles further north, and nine
miles from York. The Lancastrians intended to defend
the passage of the Aire, and encamped near Towton,
between the two rivers, but fully nine miles from the Aire.
They were apparently in complete ignorance of the rapid
advance of the Yorkists, who seized the important bridge
unopposed. Somerset, who commanded the Lancastrian
army, if any one can be said to have had supreme command,
sent forward Lord Clifford to attempt to regain Ferrybridge.
The Yorkists still more inexcusably were in their turn
surprised and cut to pieces. Again Somerset blundered,
and left Clifford unsupported. The Yorkist vanguard,
under Lord Falconbridge, was sent up the Aire, and
crossed it unopposed by the ford, difficult and dangerous in
spring when the rivers are full, three miles up at Castleford.
Clifford, in danger of being cut off, retreated on the main
army, the enemy making no attempt to pursue him: but
within little more than a mile of the camp his force was
surprised and annihilated by Falconbridge. When we
remember that English armies had been fighting in France
down to 1453, under conditions which ought to have
developed the utmost care in never neglecting a precaution
or an opportunity, and that they had been fighting at home
almost ever since, it seems scarcely credible that such a
series of astonishing blunders should have been committed
by both sides.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_b_106"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_106.jpg" width="400" height="517" alt="Map VII: Battle of Towton." />
</div>

<p>The Yorkists, marching by the two roads from Ferrybridge
and Castleford, which unite at the village of Towton,
halted on the evening of Saturday March 28, a couple of
miles from the Lancastrian position. The one thing which
every Englishman who pretended to be a general in that
age understood, was how to take up a position tactically
strong for standing on the defensive. Somerset's army was
however far too large for his capacity: he drew up his
60,000 men on a front of a mile, thereby throwing away his
advantage in numbers. For a third of his force, awaiting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a><br /><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a><br /><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>an attack from a fairly equal enemy, the position would
have been excellently chosen, assuming that he was not
going to be forced to retreat. The Lancastrian army was
posted facing south on a plateau, their right resting on a
little stream, the Cock, which in summer is a mere thread
of water, but was at that season in flood, and quite impassable.
In rear of their left was Towton village, to
which the great road ran at the bottom of a tolerably steep
slope of from 50 to 80 feet from the edge of the plateau:
the slope down to the Cock on the other flank was impracticably
steep. In front was a slight depression known
as Towton Dale, from which the ground rose again on the
south to a similar plateau. Thus the right was perfectly
secure; if the enemy attempted to turn the left they would
have to attack up a steep ascent: even in front they would
have the ground against them. Somerset had only to
place some of the useless thousands that overcrowded his
line of battle in observation on the plain east of the high-road,
ready to strike at the enemy's flank, and he could
hardly have been assailed successfully. The weak point of
the position was that the Cock bends round the rear of it,
a serious obstacle in its flooded state to retreat in case of
need, the more so as the old road from Towton descended
very steeply to the only bridge. The country being at that
date all open, retreat was possible north-eastwards, in rear
of the left, without crossing the Cock, more or less in the
direction of the modern road, which only crosses the Cock
close to its junction with the Wharfe, very near Tadcaster.
Obviously, however, should the enemy turn or defeat the
left of the army, this resource would be cut off, and defeat
would mean destruction.</p>

<p>Warwick and Edward advanced at dawn on the Sunday
morning, though their rearguard, under the duke of Norfolk,
delayed by the crossing of the Aire, was still some miles
off. Their numbers, though far inferior to those of the
enemy,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> were amply sufficient for covering a front of a mile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>The Lancastrians, having chosen their ground, naturally
did not oppose the Yorkists' advance. The latter climbed
the southern slope, and marched across the plateau, a fall
of snow preventing either party seeing the other until they
faced each other at a distance of a quarter of a mile across
Towton Dale. From this time, if not before, the snow was
driving in the faces of the Lancastrians, and Falconbridge
utilised this advantage very cleverly. He ordered his
archers to advance and begin shooting at the enemy, whom
they could dimly see: as soon as the Lancastrians, annoyed
by the arrows which they could not see coming,
began to reply, he withdrew his men a short distance, and
let the enemy waste their shafts on the open ground.
Presently the hail of Lancastrian arrows slackened, as the
supply ran short, and Falconbridge once more sent his
archers forward, and so galled the defenceless enemy that
they advanced to come to close quarters. The Lancastrians
had thus to attack up-hill through the blinding
snow, instead of compelling their antagonists to assail them
at a disadvantage. A hand-to-hand conflict all along the
line followed. Both sides fought stubbornly: orders had
been given on both sides, so the chronicler says, to give no
quarter. How long this continued it is hard to say: the
armies may very well have been face to face by seven in
the morning, though one account names nine o'clock. The
losses on the victorious side, enormous for a hand-to-hand
battle, in which the front lines only can fall, prove that it
must have lasted a long while. About noon Norfolk,
coming up at length from Ferrybridge by the great road,
took the Lancastrians in flank. Still it was only gradually
that they gave way: the battle had lasted for ten hours
before the Lancastrians finally broke and fled by the only
way open to them, towards the narrow bridge over the
Cock. The swollen stream was scarcely fordable, the
bridge was soon blocked, thousands were trampled down
in the water, till the latest fugitives escaped over a causeway
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>of their comrades' bodies. In modern times many thousands
of the defeated army would have been taken prisoners,
as happened at Blenheim when Marlborough pinned
the French right against the Danube. The fury of civil
war in the fifteenth century allowed very few prisoners to
be made. Over 30,000 corpses are said to have been
buried near Towton, of whom about a quarter were Yorkists.
How many more found their last resting-place in the river
cannot be guessed; all we know is that the Lancastrian
army was to all intents and purposes annihilated.</p>

<p>After the battle of Towton the Lancastrians would never
again have been able to shake Edward's throne, had he
continued on good terms with his great supporter Warwick.
It would be irrelevant to discuss the causes of the quarrel
between them: it suffices to say that the breach ultimately
became irreparable, and that Warwick determined to restore
Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> Before the vast power of the house of Neville,
in alliance with the Lancastrian party, and strengthened by
others whom Edward's conduct had offended, the king was
helpless, and fled the country without striking a blow. For
some months Warwick reigned in the name of the imbecile
Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr>; but in March 1471 Edward was enabled by his
brother-in-law, the duke of Burgundy, to land with a small
force at the mouth of the Humber. He deliberately perjured
himself by solemnly swearing in York Minster that
he would never again claim the crown, and that he only
came to claim his ancestral lands, and then marched southwards
to try his luck. He conducted his enterprise with
great skill and audacity, but his enemies also played completely
into his hands. Northumberland, perhaps out of
jealousy of the Nevilles, made no attempt to move southwards
with the forces he raised in the extreme north.
Montagu, Warwick's brother, who held Pontefract, apparently
did not deem himself strong enough to attack Edward
without Northumberland's co-operation. The earl of
Oxford moved from the eastern counties upon Newark, but
shrunk back in alarm when Edward turned to attack him.
Somerset was far away in the south-west. Warwick was
doing his best to gather an army in the midlands, and was
at Coventry when Edward, who had by this time accumulated
a respectable army, moved from Leicester. As he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>knew that Montagu was following Edward from the north,
and Oxford threatening him from the east, as he was every
day expecting his son-in-law the duke of Clarence to join
him from the west, Warwick chose to play a cautious game,
and let Edward pass Coventry without fighting. The next
news that Warwick heard was that Clarence had joined
Edward: without principle to keep him true to any cause,
without judgment to discern his own best interest, Clarence
was always ready to plunge into a new treason. Edward
now deemed himself strong enough to march on London,
where his cause had always been popular, and on April 11
took possession of the capital without a blow. Hearing
that Warwick was approaching, he moved out on the 13th
to meet him, and on that night the two armies bivouacked
opposite each other north of the little town of Barnet.
Warwick had been joined not only by Montagu and Oxford,
but also by Somerset: Edward had drawn considerable
reinforcements from Essex. Of the numbers on each side
very conflicting accounts are given, but from the narrative
of the battle it would seem that there was no very great
disparity, though probably Warwick had some little superiority;
neither side can well have had 20,000 men, possibly
much less.</p>

<p>The contemporary narratives are not more valuable than
most medi√¶val chronicles in determining topography with
precision, and the battle-field of Barnet has now been so
much enclosed and built over that little can be discovered
from examination of the ground. In the fifteenth century
Gladsmuir Heath, as it was then called, was open ground,
as the name implies: nor is there any trace in the narratives
of the battle having extended over the rough broken ground
which lies east of the great north road towards Monk's
Hadley. The only topographical point made in the official
Yorkist narrative is that Warwick, who was first on the
field, arranged his men more than half-a-mile north of
Barnet "under an hedge-side." There can nowhere have
been a great length of hedge, sufficient to protect even a
large part of Warwick's front; but he may well have taken
up a line of which the southern boundary of Wrotham Park
would form nearly the centre.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Nothing however turns on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>the exact shape of the ground: the battle was, like most
others of the age, a straightforward engagement all along
the line. Edward was anxious to make sure of fighting on
the morrow: he had nothing to gain by delay, and might
lose much, for Lancastrian forces were gathering in Kent.
He therefore under cover of the darkness moved up so near
to Warwick's line, that it would be impossible for either
party to retire without engaging. So near did he venture
that Warwick's guns, which were kept firing during the
night, sent their shot harmlessly over the heads of the
Yorkists. When day dawned on Easter Sunday, April 14,
Gladsmuir Heath was enveloped in so thick a mist that
neither party discovered at first that each army outflanked
the other on the right.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The battle began in the usual way
with an ineffective cannonade and some flights of arrows,
and then they came to close quarters. As might be expected,
Montagu and Oxford on the Lancastrian right
defeated Edward's left, which fled through Barnet, pursued
by Oxford, though Montagu seems not to have quitted the
line of battle. In the centre the king in person engaged in
an obstinate struggle with Somerset, and slowly gained some
advantage. Warwick on the left was partially outflanked by
Gloucester, but held his ground fairly well, though he was
gradually forced back on the centre. In the thick fog
nothing could be seen a few hundred yards off: thus Warwick
remained ignorant of the success of Oxford, who, in his
turn, was so completely bewildered by the fog that when he
turned back, after driving his own immediate opponents
through Barnet, he lost his way completely, and instead of
taking Edward in rear as he presumably aimed at doing,
went past the contending lines, and came upon the reserve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>of his own side. Here occurred the fatal mistake which
ruined Warwick's chance of victory. In the mist the silver
star of the De Veres was mistaken for Edward's cognizance,
a sun with rays: Oxford's men were received with a volley
of arrows. Instantly the notion of treachery arose: the
jealousy between the old Lancastrians and Warwick's supporters
blazed out. Oxford fled at once: Somerset followed
his example. Some of the old Lancastrians turned their
arms against the Nevilles, and Montagu, it would seem,
was killed by his own friends. Warwick saw that all was
lost: but in determining to fight on foot, in his heavy armour,
he had made flight impossible, and he was beaten down and
killed, apparently unrecognised. When Edward saw that
the victory was gained, his one anxiety was to know whether
Warwick had fallen. The corpses of Warwick and Montagu
were found, and exposed for three days in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul's
Cathedral, in order that there might be no doubt about the
great earl being really dead. Edward was quite right:
the cause of Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> was bound up with Warwick's life.
Unlike as Warwick was in personal character to the typical
feudal noble, he was in a very real sense "the last of the
Barons." The quasi-despotic monarchy of the Tudors and
Stuarts was founded on the field of Barnet.</p>

<p>On the day of the battle of Barnet, queen Margaret with
her son landed at Weymouth. She soon learned the fatal
news, and was joined by Somerset and other fugitives.
The Beauforts and Courtenays, strong in their hereditary
influence in the west, were far from believing that their
cause was ruined: and the fact that Edward waited at
Windsor till he was sure that they were not moving eastwards
towards London, implies that he at least thought
them not too weak to attempt it. The ultimate and undoubtedly
more prudent resolution of the Lancastrian leaders
was to make for Gloucester, and form a junction with the
earl of Pembroke, who was raising forces in Wales; but
their purpose was not certainly apparent until they left
Bath, and instead of seeking battle with the king, who was
by this time at Cirencester, moved on Bristol. Still it was
not quite certain that they were avoiding battle. On May 2,
Edward, who was well served by his scouts, was informed
that the enemy were in position at Sodbury, some dozen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>miles north of Bristol. He hastily moved towards them,
but on reaching Sodbury towards evening found no trace
of the enemy. The Lancastrians marched all night, and
on the forenoon of May 3 approached Gloucester, hoping
to occupy the town and there cross the Severn. The
governor of Gloucester was however a Yorkist, and refused
them admission, and the wearied Lancastrians had to continue
their march, for they knew that Edward was not far
off. There was no bridge over the Severn nearer than
Worcester: but if the Avon could be crossed at Tewkesbury
they might hope to reach Worcester unattacked, or even to
pass the Severn by boats at some nearer point. Accordingly
they struggled on ten miles further to Tewkesbury, and
there halted for the night, utterly overcome by fatigue, after
marching forty-four miles since the preceding morning. All
day Edward had been marching along the Cotswolds on a
line parallel to that followed by the Lancastrians, but some
distance in rear, though gradually gaining on them. Towards
evening, in passing through Cheltenham, he heard positively
that the enemy were in Tewkesbury; and he also halted for
the night about three miles off.</p>

<p>The author of the <cite>Arrivall of King Edward</cite>, who obviously
accompanied his master to Tewkesbury, takes great
pains to describe what he saw. Like many other writers,
he has no names but "hill" and "valley" for trifling inequalities
of ground, but otherwise he writes with unusual
precision, and there is no reason whatever for distrusting
his authority. The Lancaster position, he says, was "in a
close, even at the towne's end, the towne and abbey at their
backs, afore them, and upon every hand of them, fowle
lanes and depe dikes with hills and valleys, a ryght evill
place to approache." Their leaders doubtless deemed it
impossible to escape across the Avon without fighting, and
as they were certainly not seriously outmatched in numbers,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
they had no reason to avoid a battle. As usual in that
age they took up a position well chosen for fighting on the
defensive; but it had a muddy brook between them and
Tewkesbury, and the Avon beyond the town, so that defeat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>involved total destruction. Sir John Ramsay<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> gives a very
good map, which shows all the ancient lanes, as well as the
modern road and other things which have materially altered
the ground. It is of course impossible to discover exactly
which enclosures are ancient, and there are now no "depe
dikes." The small numbers engaged could not have covered
nearly the length of front possible according to the topography;
but the left flank must have been near the easternmost
of the ancient lanes, for the author of the <cite>Arrivall</cite>
speaks of Somerset having "passyd a lane" in his attempted
turning movement in the battle, which can have been no
other. Whatever the exact position of the Lancastrian
line, king Edward brought his own troops up opposite to
them, except that he posted two hundred spears "near a
quarter of a myle from the fielde," to watch a wood by means
of which he thought his right flank might be threatened.
The battle began with some cannonading and "shott of
arrows," in both of which the Yorkists had rather the advantage.
The position was however very difficult to assail
at close quarters, and the Lancastrians might apparently
have held it successfully, had not Somerset attempted
a counter-stroke. He, we are told, "somewhat asydehand
the king's vaward, and by certain paths and ways therefore
afore purveyed, and to the king's party unknown,
departed out of the fielde, passyd a lane, and came into a
faire place or close even afore the king where he was embattailed,
and from the hill that was in that one of the
closes, he set right fiercely upon the end of the king's
battaile." There must have been a gap between the king's
division in the centre and the vaward, or right, for this to
be possible. However the centre and right united in
pushing back this attack, and the two hundred spears above-mentioned,
falling unexpectedly on Somerset's flank, completed
his defeat. The king was then able to advance,
attack in flank the Lancastrian centre, and so rout the
whole army, which broke and fled in all directions. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>only local name that survives as a memorial of the battle is
the "Bloody Meadow" by the Avon below Tewkesbury:
this may well mark a place where many fugitives of the right
wing, cut off from the only escape into the town, were
slaughtered by the victors. Prince Edward, the last heir of
Lancaster, was killed in the battle or the pursuit&mdash;there
seems no foundation for the story which Shakespeare used,
that he was taken prisoner and killed in cold blood. Somerset,
Devon, nearly all the remaining Lancastrians of note
were killed, or were executed after the battle. Except for
the Tudor interest in Wales, the Lancastrian party was
annihilated. It required the early death of Edward <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr>,
and the murder of his nephews by Richard of Gloucester,
before Henry of Richmond could resuscitate it.</p>

<h3>INTERMEDIATE NOTE<br />

<small>GUNPOWDER</small></h3>

<p>The invention of gunpowder was slower in making itself felt
than most of the other great discoveries which have turned the
course of history. There is no intrinsic impossibility in the
statement of a contemporary Italian writer, that Edward <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>
had cannon at Crecy, though in the absence of any other
testimony it is not generally believed. He had them at the
siege of Calais immediately afterwards, though they were of
little use. The earliest firearms were of very clumsy make, slow
and difficult to load, short in range and allowing no accuracy of
aim. From the nature of the case, cannon<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> were made practically
useful earlier than hand weapons. As soon as ever gun-carriages
of a tolerably movable form were devised, it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>possible at least to use them on the battle-field, though a very
long time had still to elapse before they became important; in
the battles of the English civil war of the seventeenth century
artillery plays a very minor part. Naturally they were much
more effective in sieges, where mobility was not required, and
the slowness of fire less important. By the end of the fifteenth
century, if not sooner, it was perceived that gunpowder had
effected a revolution in this branch of warfare. In the early
middle ages a well-walled town or castle was proof against such
modes of battering as were then in use. Unless escalading
proved possible, the besiegers could only reduce the place by
starvation. With that inevitable reservation the defence was
stronger than the attack. Hence a feudal noble, possessed of a
well-situated castle, could defy the crown, for a time at least;
hence in Italy the cities could make themselves independent.
With the introduction of cannon all this was changed. The
crown, and as a rule the crown only, could afford to maintain
artillery that could be used against a fortified city or castle, and
with its aid could reduce with certainty every place which had
walls of the medi√¶val type. To fortify in a fashion that would
give a reasonable chance against cannon was out of the power
of most nobles. Thus artillery contributed largely, perhaps
more than any other single agency, to the great political change
which marks the close of the middle ages, by which the crown
becomes, at least as against the nobles, virtually absolute.</p>

<p>Firearms to be used by hand were far slower in their development,
as was natural, owing to their greater complication. The
earliest were mere tubes, elevated on a stand, miniature cannon
in fact. For a very long while they could not be fired from the
shoulder, but required to be supported on iron rests fixed into
the ground, which added seriously to the weight to be carried.
Musketeers, if one may apply the term to the soldiers who bore
the earlier firearms before the musket properly so called was
invented, were quite incapable of standing alone. They might
fire one volley at charging cavalry, but long before they could be
ready for a second, the horsemen would be cutting down their
defenceless ranks. Hence pikemen, who should do the defensive
part of the work, were a necessary adjunct to musketeers:
obviously also the pikemen alone could come to close quarters
in attacking. It was not until the invention of the bayonet
enabled the musketeer to be, so to speak, his own pikeman, that
infantry equipped with firearms could become the real backbone
of an army.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether a musket bullet<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> was ever so deadly a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>missile as the clothyard arrow, all points taken into account.
If a bullet struck armour obliquely, it would penetrate, instead of
glancing, at a greater angle than an arrow point.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> And it would
also be likely to make worse wounds, by driving in bits of the
metal. On the other hand the arrow was noiseless and smokeless,
merits which are reckoned important by modern authorities
who are seeking after smokeless powder. It had greater range
than the musket bullet, admitted of much greater accuracy of
aim, and had probably at least equal direct penetrating power,
except at very short distances. England however was the
only country in the latter middle ages which used a missile
weapon that would bear comparison even with the clumsiest
firearms. Naturally musketeers, with their pikemen, were
developed rather on the continent than in England, though
everywhere the development was slow, and the process of
superseding armour and hand-to-hand weapons very gradual.</p>

<p>The ultimate political tendency of the invention of gunpowder
was obvious. By rendering discipline more necessary for the
efficiency of the soldier, it threw power into the hands of the
state, which alone could maintain and organise bodies of trained
men, as against individuals. By making infantry the one
indispensable arm, it tended to make oppression less easy:
the class which furnishes the fighting strength of a nation
will in the long run have at least its full share of political power.
It may be only a coincidence, but it is at any rate symbolical,
that England, the country in which, thanks to the long-bow,
infantry became earliest of paramount importance in war, is also
the country in which aristocratic privileges in the strict sense of
the word, as distinguished from aristocratic influences, were of
least extent and soonest reduced to insignificance. It is also
the country in which the nation as a whole earliest felt its
strength, and taught its kings to respect the national will.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>FLODDEN</small></h2>


<p>The establishment of Scottish independence, in the teeth
of English claims to supremacy, not unnaturally led to a
feeling of opposition to England, and of consequent alliance
with France, which on the whole worked disastrously for
Scotland. Unfortunately also the policy of hostility gradually
developed in the smaller people a feeling of bitter
animosity towards their neighbours, which the English on
their side hardly felt. On the borders mutual injuries
stimulated personal hatred, but only rarely affected the
relations of the two states. The English government had
no motive for hostility to Scotland, no passion to indulge:
it would at any time have been glad of firm peace with
Scotland, but was apt to try to secure this by establishing
its influence over Scotland, rather than by relations of
equal friendliness. While the long contest with France
lasted, England had obviously every motive for desiring to
be free of a troublesome enemy in the north: but Scotland
was ever hostile. Sometimes a Scottish army invaded
England more or less in concert with the French, as when
Nevil's Cross followed hard upon Crecy. Later, Scottish
nobles and soldiers swarmed in the French armies: the defeat
of Verneuil was a heavier blow to Scotland than to France.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the success of the Scots in their many
encounters with the English, Bannockburn had been too
great a victory. The spearmen had on that day so decisively
defeated the English mailed horsemen that the Scots seem
always to have assumed that nothing could be more effective.
Time after time the English archers inflicted crushing losses
on the Scottish armies. Halidon Hill (1333), Nevil's Cross
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>(1346), Homildon (1402) are the chief instances, but not the
only ones, before the day of Flodden, the last great victory
of the bow, and perhaps the most overwhelming defeat which
a kingdom ever suffered.</p>

<p>From the accession of the house of Tudor, the English
policy was directed, more systematically than ever, towards
gaining over Scotland. The difficulty was obvious, that an
alliance between the two countries must needs mean Scotland
following in the wake of England, which was galling to
Scottish pride, and distasteful to their hereditary hatred of
the English. Henry <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr> succeeded, with the help of Spain,
in bringing Scotland for the time into his circle of allied
powers, and in cementing that union, as he hoped, by the
marriage of his eldest daughter Margaret to the young king
of Scots. Personal ties, however, seldom count for much
as against national interests and prejudices, or even against
the passions of kings: as soon as ever Henry <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr> entangled
himself in a war with France, his brother-in-law followed the
traditional practice of his predecessors and attacked England.
There were plenty of small grievances on both sides, which
might be used as pretexts; but the only adequate reason for
war was to be found in the Scottish king's own disposition.
James <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr>, with the virtues of chivalry, carried to great
lengths its fantastic follies, including total indifference to his
own wife, and susceptibility to the fascinations of other
women. Scottish chroniclers say that James was greatly
influenced by a letter from the queen of France, sending
him a turquoise ring and a sum of money, and begging him
to take three steps on English ground for her sake: and
whether this be true or not, it is in accordance with his
character. The war was not altogether welcome to Scotland:
some at least of the king's advisers thought the venture
dangerous, or desired to maintain friendly relations with
England. More than one attempt was made to work on
James' well-known superstitiousness, the most daring being
the midnight voice from the Cross at Edinburgh which Sir
Walter Scott describes in <cite>Marmion</cite>. James had however
gone too far to recede: he invaded England with an army
which is said to have amounted to 100,000 men, and which
certainly comprised every great noble in Scotland who was
capable of bearing arms.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>
<p>On August 22, 1513, the Scots crossed the border. The
king seems to have had no definite purpose beyond gratifying
his taste for knight-errantry. Norham Castle surrendered
a week later, and there was no English army as yet ready
to dispute his further advance: he might have penetrated
far into England if he had chosen. Instead of this he
occupied himself in taking Wark and other small castles,
"enterprises worthy of a border chieftain," as a Scottish
historian contemptuously remarks, and in devastating the
country, to his own speedy detriment. Unless all the
chroniclers were in a conspiracy to calumniate him, James
was guilty of a far worse folly, quite in keeping with his
character as a knight-errant, but absolutely unpardonable in
a king and a general conducting a great war. After taking
Ford Castle, he fell deeply in love with Lady Heron of
Ford, and loitered day after day near Ford for her sake,
until it was too late to advance. Meanwhile his army was
suffering, provisions were failing, and the season was rainy.
The army melted away by desertion to something like a
third of its original strength: the numbers that fought at
Flodden seem to be ascertained with tolerable certainty at
not much over 30,000 on each side. The spirit of chivalry
prevented the nobles leaving their king in the field, whatever
the common soldiers might do: they stayed with
James without influencing his conduct, and shared his
fate.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the earl of Surrey, who had been entrusted
with the defence of England during the king's absence in
France, had gathered an army, which would have been
largely overmatched at first if James had not wasted his
opportunities. Surrey knew the man he had to deal with,
and as soon as he felt himself strong enough, sent to the
Scottish king a formal challenge to fight a battle on a given
day, Friday, September 9. Of course the crowned knight-errant
accepted the challenge, and thereby precluded himself
from fighting earlier, as would have been to his obvious
advantage. The aged earl of Angus, the famous Archibald
Bell-the-Cat, who had played a great part in Scottish history
for the last half-century, is said to have vainly implored the
king not to accept: the only answer he could get was,
"Angus, if you are afraid, you can go home." After such
an insult, the old man could but go; but two of his sons
remained to die with the king.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>
<p>On September 7, Surrey reached Wooler, a few miles from
the Scottish camp: on the previous day James moved from
the low ground near Ford, and took up his position on
Flodden Edge. The lower course of the Tweed, where it
forms the boundary between England and Scotland, is
towards the north-east. About ten miles from its mouth, a
mile or two above Norham, the Till falls into it on the
English side, nearly at right angles. Flodden Edge is a
high ridge a mile or more in length, running east and west,
nearly south of the mouth of the Till, and about five miles
off; its easternmost end almost reaches the Till, just above
Ford. The descent is abrupt on the south to the wide
plain of Millfield, stretching along the Till nearly to Wooler.
On the north the slope is more gradual, and is broken by a
hollow rising to another lower ridge, beyond which the
descent is continued to Brankston. Flodden Edge was an
excellent position in which to await attack, at any rate from
the south, but an impossible one for long occupation, being
badly supplied with water, though not quite destitute of it.
Local ingenuity, anxious to gratify the lovers of poetry, and
devoid of military insight, points out a scanty spring on
Flodden Edge as the "Sybil's Well" beside which the
wounded Marmion was laid to die. As will be seen from
the details of the battle, it is simply impossible that any
Englishman should have come there, still more impossible
that Marmion should have left Clare there under charge of
his squires. Sir Walter Scott is not however in any way
answerable for this mistake: in a note he expressly says
that Sybil's well must be situated somewhere behind the
English right. The well was of course the creature of his
own imagination; and from the shape of the ground no
spot in that quarter could have given the dying Marmion a
view of the whole battle-field.</p>

<p>Surrey, on arriving at Wooler, and discovering where the
Scots were, tried to play once more on James' weakness:
he sent him a letter reproaching him for having quitted the
level ground, and challenging him to come down on the
appointed day and fight on the Millfield. This time however
James refused even to hear the herald; either he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>visited by a stray gleam of common sense, or his nobles
prevented the purport of the message from reaching him.
Surrey was not at all the man to attack a formidable position
if he could man&oelig;uvre his enemy out of it. Accordingly on
September 8 he crossed the Till at Wooler and marched
down its right bank, but far enough from the river to be
concealed from the Scots by the high ground east of it.
Halting for the night on Barmoor, he continued his march
next morning, and recrossed the Till with his vanguard and
artillery at Twizel Bridge close to its mouth, the rest of his
army crossing by fords higher up the stream. Surrey was
now between the Scots and their country: James must fight,
and his promise was given to fight on that day.</p>

<p>James was ignorant or careless of every duty of a general.
He did not know that Surrey had moved until the English
were seen in the far distance crossing Twizel Bridge. The
only precaution he had taken was to plant some cannon
to command the bridge (if there was one then) or the ford
on his right, leading across the Till to Ford.</p>

      <div class="verse">Wheeling their march, and circling still,</div>
      <div class="verse">Around the base of Flodden hill."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The censure is just, but not quite accurately placed. By
the time James was aware of Surrey's man&oelig;uvre it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>probably too late to attack him with his army half across the
river, as Wallace had done with fatal effect at Cambuskenneth.
James' first and unpardonable fault was in neglecting
to watch Surrey's movements; his second was the
usual halting between two opinions of a weak man. When
he saw Surrey's whole army advancing towards him, he could
neither be content to remain in his position, sufficiently
formidable if not so strong as on the reverse aspect, nor
resolve boldly to push on so as to encounter Surrey as soon
as possible, with the angle of the Tweed and Till to enclose
him fatally if defeated. Suddenly taking it into his head
that the Brankston ridge in front either was a better position
for himself, or would be a convenient one for the English,
he ordered his camp to be fired, that the south wind might
blow the smoke towards Surrey and conceal his movements,
and descended from Flodden Edge. It did not occur to
James that the smoke would prevent his seeing the English,
which was much more important: they were steadily on the
march and knew where they were going. It could have
been no surprise to Surrey on reaching Brankston to see the
Scots on the near ridge in front, though it was an obvious
advantage to him that they had not yet had time to get
fully into order.</p>

<p>The English army formed its line of battle on tolerably
level ground, facing south, the Scots being on higher ground.
Both armies were drawn up in the same manner, in four
divisions, with a reserve of horsemen in rear of the centre.
On the English right was Sir Edmund Howard, Surrey's
younger son; next to him his brother the Admiral, next
to him Surrey, and on the left Sir Edward Stanley, while
Lord Dacre commanded the horsemen in reserve. Nothing
is expressly said about it, but no doubt all the divisions were
composed as usual of archers and spearmen combined. On
the Scottish side the earls of Huntly and Home faced Sir
Edmund Howard, Huntly with the Gordons of the north-eastern
Highlands, Home with the borderers. Opposite to
the Admiral were Crawford and Montrose, opposite Surrey
was the king. On the Scottish right the earls of Lennox
and Argyle had with them a mass of wild Highlanders.
The earl of Bothwell was in reserve behind the centre.</p>

<p>The battle began about four p.m. with a cannonade. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>English guns were well served and did great execution;
the Scots were less skilful, and probably at a disadvantage
from their hasty move. At any rate the artillery duel, as it
would be called now-a-days, was so greatly in favour of the
English that the Scots hastened to come to close quarters.
On their left the borderers with their long spears charged
home with such determination that they broke Sir Edmund
Howard's line. The white lion banner of the Howards was
trampled in the dust, part of the English right wing fled: it
was only by the prompt support of Dacre's horsemen that
defeat on this wing was averted. In the right centre the
Admiral had a severe struggle with Crawford and Montrose,
but ultimately prevailed, both the earls being slain. On the
left the English success was much more decided: the wild
clansmen, unable to bear the clothyard arrows, broke their
ranks and dashed at the enemy, who beat them off with
great slaughter. Meanwhile James in person had engaged
Surrey, and being presently supported by the reserve under
Bothwell pressed him hard. The day however was virtually
decided: the success on the Scottish left was now more than
neutralised, for Huntly had fled apparently before Dacre's
first charge, and Home, isolated from the rest of the army,
did not venture to renew the conflict, but drew off, watched
and held in check by Dacre. The Admiral, after defeating
Crawford, took James in flank: Stanley still more fatally
attacked him on the right rear. The time for exhibiting
the best side of knight-errantry had come: James, with a
splendid courage which has more than half redeemed his
credit, refused to yield. Forming themselves into the
national circle, the Scots held their ground to the last.</p>

<p>The Scottish loss in men was heavy, about 10,000 men,
and the English paid for the victory with a loss of perhaps
half the amount. But the rank of the Scots who fell made
it a blow to the kingdom which perhaps has no equal in
history. The king, his natural son the archbishop of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Andrew's, twelve earls, or nearly every man of the highest
rank below royalty, many other lords and chiefs of clans, all
perished: there is scarcely a family of distinction in Scotland
but had a member killed at Flodden. The last victory
of the long-bow was even more complete than its first great
triumph at Crecy. For to the bow is fairly to be attributed
alike the defeat of the fierce rush of the Highlanders which
proved so formidable on other occasions, and the last
destruction wrought upon the nobles around their king.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>THE GREAT CIVIL WAR</small></h2>


<p>Civil wars are not all of the same type. Sometimes the
division is geographical, as in the great war between the
northern and southern states of the American Union;
sometimes the people throughout the country are separated
into opposing ranks. Of course in neither case is the line
likely to be drawn quite sharply: there were partisans of
the north in the Confederate States: the preponderant
feeling in some districts at least of a country divided against
itself is sure to be strongly on one side or the other. The
great English civil war of the seventeenth century is an
instance of the latter type, though not in its most clearly
marked form. There were large regions which were very
decidedly royalist, others almost as distinctly parliamentarian;
but certainly there was something of royalist feeling
everywhere, and probably anti-royalist feeling also. These
facts determine to so large an extent the nature and course of
the war that it cannot be understood without keeping them
in mind. They give a political reason for conduct on both
sides, which from the purely military point of view must be
regarded as mistaken. No competent general in an ordinary
war will fritter away his forces in holding a number of
small posts: he will only occupy those which are of importance
to his operations in the field, well knowing that
victory will give him possession of the rest. In the English
civil war both parties acted on the principle that it was
worth while to hold posts in districts where the enemy predominated,
as means of keeping alive the spirit of their own
partisans in those regions: and both sides deemed it well
worth while to capture such posts, at the cost of greatly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>weakening their armies in the field. Nor can it be doubted
that in the main they were right under the circumstances,
though possibly there were instances in which acting in this
manner was mistaken. In civil war it is emphatically true
that until every spark is extinguished there is always a risk
of the fire breaking out afresh.</p>

<p>The merits of the quarrel between Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> and his
Parliament need not be discussed. Given that the question
had once been raised whether the king was to be in the
last resort master, or be bound to defer to the distinct wish
of his people, a solution was only to be obtained by the
king, or the representatives of the nation, definitely giving
way. The ancient traditions of self-government made it
certain that the Parliament would not yield except to armed
force: the character and convictions of Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> made it
equally certain not only that he would not yield, but that
the conflict would be precipitated, rather than postponed,
by his action.</p>

<p>England had not followed the example of the continental
nations, which during the sixteenth century formed standing
armies. Just before the civil war, there were no troops at
all in England: in fact it was the necessity for putting
down the Irish rebellion that brought about the final
breach, as the Parliament would not trust the king with
uncontrolled authority over the forces to be levied, and
Charles would not bate an inch of his ancient prerogative.
Hence it was of importance in the beginning of the war
that the best raw material for an army was mainly on the
king's side. Most of the gentry were royalist; and they,
with their gamekeepers, grooms, etc., were naturally better
skilled in the use of firearms, and (what was even more
important) were more accustomed to riding than the rest of
the population. The strong supporters of the Parliament
were mostly found in the towns, merchants and shopkeepers,
men ignorant of warlike pursuits, and little suited
or inclined to incur in their own persons the hardships of
war. England as a nation had engaged in no land warfare
within living memory, except Buckingham's ill-conducted
expedition to the Isle of Rh√©. Many Englishmen however
had seen service on the continent, in the earlier stages of
the Thirty Years' War or in the last years of the Dutch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>War of Independence; and those who served under
Maurice or Frederick Henry of Nassau, still more under
the great Gustavus,<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> learned in a good school. Thus there
was a fair supply of officers possessing some experience,
though few of them exhibited any great military skill, again
mostly on the king's side; and the royalist soldiers, having
already some useful knowledge, were fairly soon converted
into adequate troops. The parliamentary recruits were
largely drawn in the first instance from the lowest classes
of the towns; and though, thanks to natural courage and
stubbornness, the infantry proved always a match for the
royalists, their cavalry, an arm which was in that age of
primary importance, and obviously required much more
time for training, proved themselves defective. A remedy
was presently found: we are told that Oliver Cromwell, then
only a captain, after seeing in the first battle the panic rout
of most of the parliamentary horse, observed to his cousin
Hampden, that they must have men of another stamp to
match with these men of honour. He set to work to
bring into the ranks the stern Puritan yeomen of the
eastern counties, and to inspire them with a spirit of strict
discipline. This took time, and for many months after the
war began the king had on the whole the advantage; but
no enemy ever got the better of Cromwell's Ironsides, and
from the date at which cavalry animated by his ideas came
into the field in any numbers, the preponderance went over
decisively to the Parliament.</p>

<p>Though, as has been said, there was hardly a spot in
England where both parties had not adherents, yet roughly
speaking a line drawn from Hull to Weymouth would
divide England into a larger royalist half, and a smaller
parliamentarian half, as things were just after the war had
begun. The Parliament had its headquarters in London:
the eastern counties, using that term very widely, were
strongly on its side: and though the royalists were fairly
numerous in Kent, Surrey and Hants, yet they were there
so far overmatched by their opponents that the authority of
Parliament was recognised. The king, whose headquarters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>after the first movements of the war were fixed in Oxford,
was preponderant in the north (except Lancashire), in
Wales (except Pembrokeshire) and the border counties,
and in Cornwall, while the other south-western counties
were more equally divided.</p>

<p>Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> finally set up his standard at Nottingham late
in August 1642, whence he moved westwards to Chester,
and when he had gathered sufficient forces marched on
London. The earl of Essex, commanding the parliamentary
army, had gone to Worcester to meet the king,
and the first skirmish of the war took place at Powick
bridge, just south of that city, on the very ground where
nine years later was fought the last battle, the "crowning
mercy" as Cromwell called it, which extinguished Charles
<abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>'s last hopes of being restored by the aid of the Scots.
It is a proof of the real inexperience of both sides that
Charles and Essex moved towards London a few miles
apart without either apparently being fully aware what the
other was doing. On October 23 the king, who had the
start, but had now come into hostile country, and therefore
could not advance safely without beating off Essex, turned
and fought at Edgehill on the southern edge of Warwickshire.
The battle still further illustrated the rawness of
both armies. The royalists gave away an advantage by
coming down a fairly steep slope to meet their assailants:
prince Rupert with the main body of their cavalry, after defeating
the parliamentary horse opposed to him, pursued them
headlong far away from the field, and then took to plundering
Essex's baggage. The smaller body on the other wing
were even more reckless, for they drove off only part of the
cavalry opposed to them, leaving two small regiments untouched,
in one of which was Cromwell's troop. How
far this was due to want of discipline among the men, how
far to lack of judgment in their commanders, it is difficult
to tell; but the result was most disastrous to the king's
cause. The infantry on both sides fought bravely, but two
or three of Essex's regiments had been broken by the flying
horsemen, and the king would have won a considerable
victory but for the vigorous and effective way in which the
few hundred cavalry that had escaped attack co-operated
with the infantry. The clumsy, ill-made, slow-firing muskets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>of the seventeenth century were not very formidable to
cavalry, and a charge pressed home in earnest had a very
good chance against a mixed body of musketeers and pikemen,
unless the latter were fresh and in good order. When
prince Rupert at length returned to the field, Essex's infantry
had got on the whole the best of it, though the
royalists were hardly defeated: it was too late to begin
again, and the battle remained drawn. The king's one
chance of finishing the war at a blow was lost.</p>

<p>Charles advanced as far as Brentford, but the troops
drawn out for the defence of London were too strong to
be attacked, and he withdrew to Oxford, and entered on
useless negotiations for peace. When active hostilities were
resumed in the spring of 1643, all went favourably for the
king. John Hampden, one of the most important leaders
in the House of Commons, was killed in a skirmish: a
series of successes in the field gave the whole south-west,
with the important exception of Plymouth, into royalist
hands: a victory at Atherton Moor drove Fairfax into Hull,
and made the king master of all the rest of Yorkshire.
Had Charles boldly marched on London, it is possible that
the citizens in their dismay would have submitted. But
Charles was hardly the man to take an audacious resolve;
and it would have been audacious, even if no stronger word
be applicable, to advance on London with his own immediate
forces. His right wing, so to speak, was tied to the
west by Plymouth, the garrison of which, if left unbesieged,
would soon have revived the partisans of Parliament in the
west. His left wing was still more closely fettered by the
necessity of observing Hull. Moreover behind the king
lay Gloucester, well garrisoned, and interrupting at a vital
point, the lowest bridge on the Severn, free communication
between the royalists of the south and west. Ordinary
military judgment pointed out the capture of Gloucester as
the most useful enterprise he could attempt, while waiting
for the co-operation of Hopton from the west, of Newcastle
from the north. The Parliament realised the supreme
importance of Gloucester, and Essex, with an army consisting
largely of the London train-bands, marched to
relieve the place. Charles was obliged to raise the siege,
and on his return to Oxford fought with Essex the bloody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>and indecisive battle of Newbury. The tide of royalist
success had been stemmed, but no more. The outlook for
the parliamentary cause seemed so gloomy that Pym, their
greatest statesman, negotiated with his dying breath, at the
price of important concessions to the Presbyterian spirit,
for the assistance of the Scots for the next campaign. Things
however were in reality less black than they seemed: in
the eastern counties not only had their cause completely
triumphed, but an army was being organised which was to
turn the scale in the next year. This army was commanded
by the earl of Manchester, under whom was Cromwell at
the head of the cavalry, which was the specially important
arm. In it the ideas which Cromwell had been the first to
act on were definitely carried out. To quote the description
of it sent to London by an admiring correspondent of a
newspaper&mdash;"Neither is his army so formidable in number
as exact in discipline; and that they might be all of one
mind in religion as of resolution in the field, with a severe
eye he hath looked into the manners of all those who are
his officers, and cashiered those whom he found to be in
any way irregular in their lives or disaffected to the cause.
This brave army is our violets and primroses, the first-fruits
of the spring, which the Parliament sends forth this year,
for the growth of our religion, and the re-implanting of this
kingdom in the garden of peace and truth."</p>

<p>Early in 1644 a Scottish army crossed the Tweed, and
gradually pushed Newcastle back, till in April, when Fairfax
was able to unite with them, they were strong enough to
shut him up in York. Two or three weeks earlier Waller
had won a victory at Cheriton in Hampshire, which finally
assured the south-east to the Parliament, and which, though
on a small scale, is an interesting prelude to Marston Moor,
as exhibiting superiority of discipline passed over to the
parliamentary side. Two or three weeks later Manchester's
army came up to help in the siege of York. Newcastle
was clearly doomed, unless assistance reached him. Months
before, prince Rupert had been despatched by Charles with
a small body of men to raise an army in the Severn region,
and he was now, in accordance with his own earnest wish,
ordered to relieve York. Making his way up through
Lancashire, he ultimately crossed the Pennine hills from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>Skipton into the valley of the Wharfe. The governing
committee of the Parliament had been anxious that the
armies of Manchester and Fairfax should be sent into
Lancashire to encounter Rupert, who had spent more than
a month in taking various small places. Rupert was acting
on the plan largely followed throughout the war; but on
this occasion at least it was very mistaken policy. The
capture of Newcastle's army in York would have been ill
compensated by advantages tenfold greater than Rupert
obtained in Lancashire; and York was very nearly lost.
The generals were wiser than their government: they
refused to raise the siege while a chance remained of
capturing the city. If Rupert appeared they would fight
him; and then, as they wrote to the committee, "if it
please God to give us the victory, all Lancashire and
Yorkshire will fall to us." At the same time they were
well aware that in that case they would have to raise the
siege, and they therefore pressed it vigorously, all the more
so after intercepting a letter from Newcastle begging Rupert
to make haste, as he could only hold out a few days longer.
But for the folly of Crawford,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> third in command under
Manchester, who exploded a mine without waiting for the
co-operation of the Scots or of Fairfax, so that his own
assault being unsupported was repulsed, York would in fact
have been taken; but Crawford's failure gave the besieged
just respite enough. On June 30 the generals heard that
Rupert was at Knaresborough, only twelve miles off; the
next morning therefore they raised the siege and marched
towards him. Rupert however made a circuit northwards,
crossing the Ure at Boroughbridge, and came down the left
bank of the Ouse to join Newcastle, protected by the river
from any possibility of the parliamentary forces intercepting
him or taking him in flank. The fiery prince, who had in
his pocket a letter from the king which he averred to be
positive orders<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> to fight the rebels, and who was Newcastle's
superior officer, insisted on marching at once after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>enemy. It cannot for a moment be maintained that he was
wrong; though he was slightly inferior in numbers, his
enemies might very reasonably be assumed to be hampered,
as in fact they were, by difficulties arising from divided
command, and from divergence of views as to the most
important object to be attained.</p>

<p>The parliamentary army had moved westward from York,
on the morning of July 1, and marched about half-way to
Knaresborough. When the generals found that Rupert had
given them the slip, and that a battle was out of the question
unless he came out of York to seek them, serious difference
of opinion seems to have arisen. The Scots, we are told,
the earl of Leven and his lieutenant-general David Leslie,
were for the prudent course of retreating. Considerable
reinforcements were expected, and the junction with them
would be best secured by retiring on Tadcaster. The
English generals, or some of them, were for holding their
ground; if this be true, it is safe to assume that Cromwell
was for fighting, and probably also the Fairfaxes, father and
son, as they were always of one mind, and usually for bold
counsels. Whatever may have been the opinions, there was
no supreme authority, and it was therefore inevitable that
the prudent plan should be adopted. On July 2 the
infantry started for Tadcaster; the cavalry, or a great part
of the cavalry (for all the three lieutenant-generals were
with them), remained on the moor to cover the retreat.
About two o'clock Rupert's army was seen approaching from
York; a message was sent hastily after the infantry, who
retraced their steps, and assumed a position in which to
await the oncoming royalists. Rupert was in no situation
to attack at once; in fact he himself was not on the field
till later, having been detained in York in order to appease
Newcastle's troops, who were mutinous for lack of pay.
During the whole afternoon the two armies "looked one
another in the face." Why Leven was unwilling to attack
then, and did so at evening, when Newcastle's men had
reached the field, is not easy to understand: possibly the
conflict of opinion, whether or not to fight if they had the
option, was still undecided. At any rate it was not till
about seven o'clock that the action was begun, by the advance
of their whole line.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>
<p>The battle of Marston Moor is in some respects one of
the simplest ever fought. Very little depended on the
ground, either in its natural formation, or in artificial features
such as enclosures. The armies came straight into collision
along their whole front. The numbers differed but little,
the stubborn courage of both sides was unmistakably great,
yet on both sides large bodies were utterly broken up by
defeat. Yet from another point of view Marston Moor is
possessed of very special interest: the battle was won by
the perfect discipline of Cromwell's horse, and by the coolness
which prevented him from being carried away by the excitement
of immediate victory, and losing sight of the general
issue.</p>

<p>The parliamentary army was posted on a ridge of ground
lying south of the wide expanse of moorland, now all enclosed
and cultivated, which stretched nearly to York. At
the northern foot of this ridge, which was covered at the
time of the battle with rye full grown though not ripe, runs
a lane joining two hamlets, Long Marston and Tockwith,
about a mile and a half apart. North of this line the
moor rose, quite open and bare, though there was a wood
a mile or so to the northwards. The moor was divided
from the lane by a ditch, which has since disappeared, and
therefore cannot be placed with accuracy. A little way
from this ditch Rupert drew up his line, so near to it in fact
that a battle must ensue, as neither side could possibly
withdraw in safety. At the same time the ditch was a
sufficient obstacle to make both sides somewhat reluctant
to begin. Neither side seems to have thought it worth
while to attempt to utilise the enclosures of Long Marston
or Tockwith: indeed they could not have been occupied
without departing from the established tactics of the day,
which drew up the infantry in the centre, placing cavalry on
each wing. Obviously the enclosures would have been fatal
to the full use of the cavalry.</p>

<p>The threefold division of the parliamentary army was
naturally retained in the order of battle. Manchester's
troops were on the left of the line, Cromwell's cavalry
reinforced by three Scottish regiments under David Leslie
being on the flank, and the infantry commanded by Crawford
to their right. In the centre were part of the Scottish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>infantry under Baillie; to their right Lord Fairfax commanded
his own infantry, with the rest of the Scots in
reserve behind him. The extreme right was occupied by Sir
Thomas Fairfax's horse, again with a reserve of Scottish
cavalry in rear. The numbers seem to have been about
19,000 foot and 7600 horse, the royalists having some
3000 less infantry but being equally strong in cavalry. The
proportion of cavalry to infantry is enormous if measured by
modern standards, though it was exceeded in some other
battles of the war. This was of course natural, in view of
the superior value of cavalry in action, as compared to the
ill-armed infantry of that age. The royalist line was formed
in a similar fashion. Rupert's infantry was on the right, Newcastle's
on the left; the prince commanded in person the
horse on the right wing, Goring those on the left. It seems
strange to a modern reader, who habitually associates the
idea of marked uniform colours with the soldier's appearance,
to find that Newcastle's infantry attracted special notice as
the Whitecoats, because the marquis had clothed them alike
in undyed cloth, and that the parliamentary soldiers all wore
white ribbons or paper in their hats in order to recognise
one another. An equally marked contrast with the warfare
of to-day is to be found in the fact that both sides, having
twenty or thirty guns, merely used them during the afternoon
for a little futile cannonading, and ignored them entirely in
the real battle.</p>

<p>Rupert had, as we have seen, put it out of his power to
decline battle, by drawing up his line so close to the enemy.
No doubt he had fully intended to attack as soon as Newcastle
came up; but the cautious veteran who commanded
Newcastle's foot urged that it was too late in the day, and
Rupert, according to one account, called for food, saying he
would attack them in the morning. But he had no longer
the choice: almost at this moment the enemy's whole line
advanced, the left slightly leading. Rupert at once charged
Cromwell's horse, and in the first collision got the advantage,
Cromwell himself being slightly wounded. Leslie however
who followed soon turned the scale back again, and before
long Rupert's hitherto unbeaten cavalry was totally routed.
In front of Crawford the ditch had been filled up, and the
royalists had apparently crowded in to their left for the sake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>of the protection the ditch afforded. This was a serious
mistake, for Crawford advancing at first unchecked could
turn and take the royalist infantry in flank, thus greatly
facilitating Baillie's passage of the ditch. The royalists
defended themselves stubbornly, but they were still getting
the worst of it. On the right however things had gone very
differently. In front of Fairfax the moor was covered with
furze-bushes, which compelled him to advance by a lane
which led up on to the moor from the country road behind
which had been their original position. This gave an obvious
advantage to his immediate opponents, who occupied enclosures
on each side of the lane, and inflicted on Fairfax a
check, which the overthrow of the cavalry on his right converted
into rout. Sir Thomas Fairfax there encountered
Goring with signal ill success. He himself with his own
troop broke through the enemy, but the remainder were
driven back on the infantry, scattering them utterly. The
Scottish cavalry was apparently swept away by the rush of
fugitives, whom Goring with most of his men pursued far off
the field, and then turned to plunder the enemy's baggage.
The precedent of Edgehill was followed, with even more
disastrous results. For the moment however the battle
seemed still to be going well for the royalists. Some of
Goring's command had been sufficiently alive to common
sense to remain on the field; and their attack on the flank
of the Scottish infantry, combined with the Whitecoats in
front, gradually broke most of it. Baillie with three regiments
stood his ground heroically; but Leven himself came
at last to the conclusion that the day was lost, and fled from
the field, never halting, according to the perhaps slanderous
report of narrators who did not love the Scots, till he
reached Leeds. Help came just in time to save Baillie
from destruction, and ultimately convert defeat into decisive
victory. Cromwell had by this time completed the rout of
Rupert's wing, and had halted, with his men well in hand,
behind the royalist line, to make out how the battle was
going and where he could strike in effectually. Sir Thomas
Fairfax, tearing off his white badge, had succeeded in making
his way round the rear of the royalists, and encountering
Cromwell was able to tell him what was happening under
the smoke. He saw at once his opportunity. Bidding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>Leslie charge into the rear of the Whitecoats, he led his
own men round, as Fairfax had come, encountered and
totally routed Goring's horsemen, returning in confusion
from their reckless raid. The Whitecoats perished almost
to a man: and then Cromwell and Leslie had no difficulty in
completing the victory, by breaking up the rest of the royalist
infantry, with which Crawford and Baillie had been engaged.</p>

<p>A battle so stubbornly contested and involving such
vicissitudes was necessarily a bloody one. According to
one eye-witness over 4000 bodies were buried on the field.
The royalist cause was utterly ruined in the north, though
prince Rupert rallied a few thousand men. York surrendered
in a few days: before the winter nothing was left
to the king in the whole of the north and northern midlands
except a few isolated posts. Marston Moor is rightly regarded
as the turning-point of the civil war. The victory
was conspicuously due to Oliver Cromwell personally, and
to the troops raised by him and trained on his principles.
This naturally gave great additional weight to the Independents,
the party partly religious and partly political which
he represented&mdash;all the more so because of the comparative
failure of the Scots, the champions of Presbyterianism,
whose valour was in truth somewhat unfairly decried. The
most important, for the time being at least, of the ideas of the
Independents was the conviction that the war could only be
adequately waged by strong measures, by leaders who meant
to win thoroughly, and by troops that could and would fight
effectively. The victory of Marston Moor was a clinching
argument in favour of the New Model army. Marston
Moor was however much more than the decisive event in
a conflict between two contending parties. It produced
consequences more far-reaching than any battle ever fought
on British soil, except perhaps Hastings. If ideas rule the
world, it is one of the most important in human history.
When the royalist gentry went down before Cromwell's
Ironsides, absolutism received its death-wound. The great
issue, whether the king or the nation should be supreme,
was decided in favour of the nation, though generations had
yet to elapse before the full results were attained. And
since England alone set the example, and stored up the
ideas, from which political liberty in other countries has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>been derived, it is hard to see what hope would have been
left for sober freedom anywhere.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Had Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> definitely
triumphed in the civil war, and stamped out by force Puritanism
in the widest sense of the word, the circle of absolute
monarchies would have been complete. The United States
of America, the French Republic, the constitutional Parliaments
of Germany, Austria, Italy owe their existence to the
victory of Marston Moor.</p>

<p>Great however as the ultimate political consequences
were, the immediate military results of Marston Moor were
limited to the north. While Rupert was approaching York,
the king began a campaign in the south, which, thanks to
the obstinacy of Essex, was completely successful. Essex
and Waller, each in command of a small army, were left to
face the king at Oxford: and if they could have cordially
co-operated, they ought to have been at least a match for
him. The rivalry between them was however too strong,
nor was the governing committee in a position to dismiss
either. Essex insisted on marching into the south-west,
which he hoped to regain, and on leaving Waller to cope
with Charles. Waller's forces were however very difficult
to keep together: his money was expended, and his men were
nearly all enlisted for very short periods. Charles found
no difficulty in leaving Oxford adequately guarded, and
following Essex. The latter, in a country on the whole
unfriendly, was ultimately driven into Cornwall, where his
infantry surrendered or dispersed, though he himself with
his cavalry escaped by sea. When the king returned eastward,
the difficulties of the Parliament reached their height.
Essex and Waller agreed as little as ever, and Manchester,
whose army had now been drawn down from the eastern
counties, was more impracticable than either. The army
which encountered Charles on October 17 in a second
battle at Newbury, was directed by a council in which sat
two civilians: there was no commander over the whole.
Naturally the result of the action was indecisive. Fought
on intricate ground, it was an infantry battle; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>soldiers of the Parliament proved themselves somewhat
superior in the stubborn determination which was in truth
conspicuous on both sides. As the final result the king was
able, not without heavy loss, to return to his head-quarters
at Oxford, without losing the minor posts which served as
its outlying defences.</p>

<p>During the winter the Independent party, who were in
earnest about crushing the king's power, and many of whom
were inclined to believe that the only means of reaching a
permanent settlement lay in deposing him, gained the upper
hand in the House of Commons. They saw the necessity
of organising an army the soldiers of which should be permanently
enlisted and brought under thorough discipline,
on the model in fact of Cromwell's regiments. They saw
also the necessity of removing from the command men like
Manchester, and even Essex, who were almost as much
afraid of victory which should destroy the king, as of defeat
which should leave him absolute. As a means to this end
they proposed the Self-denying Ordinance, which disqualified
all members of both houses from holding military commands;
but the Lords rejected it. The latter however agreed
to the scheme for a New Model army, to consist of 21,000
men regularly paid out of the taxes, and therefore dependent
on no mere local resources, to be commanded by the younger
Fairfax. Having done so they passed a new Self-denying
Ordinance, which merely required that members of both
houses should resign the posts they held, but contained no
proviso against re-appointment. It is plain that the Lords
were actuated by motives partly selfish, partly political: they
desired if possible to retain control over the armies. But
the result of their action was to make possible the retention
of Cromwell's invaluable services; he, on the contrary, out
of zeal for the cause, had inspired the first proposal, which
would have compelled him to retire. The organisation of
the New Model was none too rapidly completed; but when
it did take the field it proved irresistible.</p>

<p>The need of the Parliament was all the greater because
for the campaign of 1645 their Scottish auxiliaries were
practically not available. Late in the previous summer
Montrose had succeeded in inducing a great part of the
Highlands to take up arms for the king, and in a series of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>short campaigns, continued contrary to the usual practice of
that age through the winter, had inflicted so many blows on
the king's enemies all over Scotland that Leven's army was
much wanted at home. Rupert, who was in the Severn
region, urged his uncle to join him with all available troops,
and make a push northwards, so as to defeat or drive away
Leven's much diminished forces, and restore the royalist
cause in the north of England, before the New Model army
was ready. But for a brilliant dash made by Cromwell,
who at the head of 1500 cavalry swept right round Oxford,
defeating one detachment after another, and clearing the
neighbourhood of all draught horses, there might have been
time to achieve much. The delay thus caused prevented
Charles from taking the field for some little time: but the
Parliament went far towards neutralising this advantage by
instructing Fairfax to go into Somerset and relieve Taunton,
the most strongly Puritan town of the west, which was in
great straits. Hearing that the king had called to Oxford
some of the royalist troops in the west, they recalled Fairfax,
too late to prevent the king marching where he pleased.
They followed up this waste of time, which was not altogether
their fault, by the error of bidding Fairfax besiege Oxford,
where the king was not: it ought to have been sufficiently
plain that to defeat the king's army in the field was the one
paramount object. The king however, instead of either
going northwards in earnest, which might have achieved
something, or gathering every available man to face Fairfax,
which would at any rate have brought matters boldly to a
crisis, pushed across to Leicester, which he stormed after a
few days' siege. Here he heard that Oxford was badly
straitened for provisions, and must surrender unless soon
relieved. Nothing can more strongly mark the incompetence
of the king and his officers to administer, however they
might fight, than his having left his head-quarters on a vague
campaign, without having satisfied himself that the city was
adequately provisioned to stand the siege which he knew
was impending. There was nothing for it but to turn back
towards Oxford. At Daventry the king learned that Fairfax
had abandoned the siege; and he accordingly halted, not
venturing to go northwards again until he knew that Oxford
was properly supplied.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>
<p>On the news of the storm of Leicester, the Parliament
bade Fairfax take the field against the king, and at the same
time acceded to the unanimous request of Fairfax's officers
that Cromwell might be appointed to the vacant post of
lieutenant-general. Such was the presumptuous contempt
of the royalists for the New Model, that they allowed Fairfax
to approach within a dozen miles of Daventry before they
heard that he was moving towards them at all. They then
withdrew a little further north to Market Harborough, but
on Fairfax pressing on they saw that a battle was inevitable,
and returned southwards to meet him.</p>

<p>The battle of Naseby merits but little description; it was
Marston Moor over again, only with the superiority of
numbers greatly on the parliamentary side; and therefore
victory was much more easily won. Fairfax drew up his
army behind the crest of a line of hills, so that the enemy
could not see their numbers till he was committed to an
attack. As usual the infantry was in the centre, with
Skippon at their head; Cromwell commanded the cavalry
on the right wing, Ireton on the left. The royalist infantry
was under Sir Jacob Astley, Rupert on the right wing,
Langdale on the left, Charles himself headed a small reserve.
Fairfax numbered less than 14,000 men, but even so he had
nearly double the king's strength. As in all the battles of
the war where the ground did not absolutely prevent it,
there was a direct attack all along the line, the royalists
having the disadvantage of advancing up-hill. The infantry
engaged in a fierce struggle, which remained doubtful till
the cavalry intervened. Ireton was somewhat hampered by
the roughness of the ground, and a great part of his wing
was defeated by Rupert's charge and pursued off the field.
It seems scarcely credible that Rupert should have been so
feather-brained, after repeated experience: but he galloped
as far as Naseby village, a mile and more in rear, and would
have plundered Fairfax's baggage had not the guard fired
on him. Then he awoke to his duty, and returned to the
field, but even in that short time the battle was over.
Cromwell had had no real trouble in overthrowing the
weaker royalist cavalry opposed to him; as they bore down
upon the reserve, followed hard by part of Cromwell's force,
the king ordered his reserve cavalry to charge the pursuers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>and rode forward to place himself at their head. As he did
so, one of his suite seized his bridle, and turned his horse
round, exclaiming "Will you go upon your death?" It was
the best thing Charles could have done, for his own fame
and for the cause he represented. He yielded however,
and the reserve retreated a little way, and then halted again
to await the inevitable. Cromwell, and the unbroken parts
of Ireton's wing, were meanwhile charging into the flanks
and rear of the royalist infantry. Many surrendered, the
rest were cut to pieces: the king's infantry ceased to exist.
When Rupert had by a circuit regained the king, there was
nothing left but to escape. The king's baggage fell into the
hands of the victors, including all his correspondence. The
Parliament with excellent judgment instantly published a
selection of the letters, under the title of "The King's
Cabinet Opened," which did more harm to his cause than
the loss of the battle of Naseby. The one unpardonable
offence in the eyes of Englishmen has ever been the bringing
in of foreigners to interfere in their affairs. And Charles
was convicted out of his own mouth of incessant intrigues to
get help not only from Irish and Scottish Celts, who though
fellow-subjects were detested as semi-savages, but from
France, Holland, Lorraine, from any one who could be
importuned or bribed (with promises only) to send him
aid.</p>

<p>The king with his usual optimism thought all could yet
be put right: even the total overthrow of Montrose two or
three months later did not impress him. The war was
however virtually decided at Naseby, though all hostilities
had not quite terminated a year later. The New Model
army made short work with the royalists in Somersetshire;
the last force which the king had in the open field was
crushed at Stow on the Wold; castle after castle surrendered.
The king presently shut himself up in Oxford, whence in
the spring of 1646 he stole across England and took refuge
in the camp of the Scots, to their extreme discomfiture.
After an interval the Scots yielded up the king on the
demand of the English Parliament. Many months elapsed,
filled with negotiations for the restoration of Charles to his
throne on terms, negotiations rendered abortive partly by
the antagonism between Independents and Presbyterians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>mainly by the king's own incurable inability to look facts in
the face, or to abide by any plan or promise. An attempt
of the moderate party in Scotland to restore him to his
throne, by an invasion combined with risings of the English
royalists, failed disastrously. The Independents held Charles
to be guilty of this wanton bloodshed, and forcibly ejecting
their opponents from the House of Commons took possession
of the government. Their first act was to bring
Charles to trial and public execution: their next to declare
the monarchy and the House of Lords abolished, and to
confide the executive authority to a council chosen by the
Commons. This new experiment in politics worked with
very fair success, seeing that they had all the world against
them outside England, and were only supported in England
itself by a comparatively small minority, who however had
the enormous advantage of knowing their own minds.
Cromwell was sent over to reduce Ireland to submission,
which he did effectively. He had hardly completed the
task when he was recalled to make war on Scotland, which
had declared for Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr></p>

<p>On July 22, 1650, Cromwell crossed the Tweed, and
marched towards Edinburgh. His old coadjutor at Marston
Moor, David Leslie, was in command against him, and
by skilful man&oelig;uvring in the country round the capital,
managed to keep Cromwell at bay for several weeks, without
being forced to an engagement. Supplies at length
began to fail, and Cromwell reluctantly began a retreat by
the coast road as far as Dunbar. If supplies could be
brought him thither by sea, which depended on the weather,
there being no good harbour, he could still hold his
ground: if not he must retire into England. Leslie followed
at once, further inland; having the shorter distance
to go he succeeded in blocking the roads beyond Dunbar,
and encamped on the heights to landward of the town,
Cromwell occupying the level ground along the seashore.
The Scottish position was unassailable, as Leslie's positions
had been in Midlothian: moreover there had been a good
deal of sickness in the English army, due chiefly to the wet
weather, which had reduced its numbers to little more than
half those of the enemy. Unless Leslie made a mistake,
Cromwell would have to embark, and confess that he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>failed totally. It was reported afterwards that the committee
of the Presbyterian Kirk pressed Leslie not to allow
Cromwell to escape, and that he in consequence made the
disastrous move which led to his defeat. There is however
no adequate authority for this, any more than for the well-known
anecdote that Cromwell, noting Leslie's false move,
exclaimed, "The Lord hath delivered them into our hand:"
either would be in keeping, and is therefore all the more
likely to have been invented. The one excuse for Leslie's
blunder lay in the fact that his army was encamped on bare
hills in frightful weather, a state of things which could not
be continued indefinitely. Confidence in his superior
numbers may easily have led him to believe that he could
afford to move down and force Cromwell to fight: possibly
a safe way of doing this might have been found, but the
movement he actually made exposed him to a fatal
blow.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_b_147"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_147.jpg" width="400" height="586" alt="Map IX: Battle of Dunbar." />
</div>

<p>A little stream called the Brocksburn flows along the
base of the hills on which Leslie was posted, and then
northwards across into the sea, a mile or so east of Dunbar,
flowing at the bottom of a little ravine which it has hollowed
out for itself. There were but two points where the steep
banks of this ravine were broken enough to allow even
carts to pass, one close under the hills, which was held by
Leslie's outposts, the other a little way out into the plain,
where the high-road from Dunbar towards Berwick runs.
Cromwell's army lay on the Dunbar side of this stream,
which formed something of a defence for his front. If
Leslie could occupy the spot where the high-road crosses
the Brocksburn, he could compel an action when he
pleased, besides more effectually blocking any communication
with England. In order however to do this, he drew
down his whole army on to the narrow strip of ground
between the burn and the base of the steep slope, and then
edged his whole line somewhat to the right, so that his
right wing, with most part of his cavalry, lay beyond the
road. Cromwell coming out of Dunbar to his camp late in
the afternoon, saw the movement being completed. He
instantly perceived the opportunity it gave him, and pointed
it out to Lambert his major-general: "to which he
instantly replied that he had thought to have said the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a><br />
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>thing to me." The opportunity was much like that which
Marlborough saw at Ramillies, and was used with equally
decisive effect. If Leslie's right wing were attacked with
superior force, it could be overpowered before the rest of
the army, cramped in the narrow strip of ground between
the Brocksburn and the hill, could move to its support.
And Cromwell could bring overwhelming strength to bear
in spite of his inferiority of numbers, because the enemy
could not cross the burn elsewhere to make a counter
attack. Under cover of darkness the English troops could
be massed opposite the slope giving access across the burn
to the enemy's position.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The assault was to have been
made at dawn on September 3, but was a little delayed:
the enemy were consequently not surprised. "Before our
foot could come up, the enemy made a gallant resistance,
and there was a very hot dispute at sword's-point between
our horse and theirs. Our first foot after that they had
discharged their duty (being overpowered with the enemy)
received some repulse, which they soon recovered. For
my own regiment under the command of lieutenant-colonel
Goffe, and my major, White, did come seasonably
in; and, at the push of pike, did repel the stoutest regiment
the enemy had there, merely with the courage the Lord
was pleased to give. Which proved a great amazement to
the residue of their foot; this being the first action between
the foot. The horse in the meantime did, with a great
deal of courage and spirit, beat back all oppositions; charging
through the bodies of the enemy's horse and of their
foot: who were, after the first repulse given, made by the
Lord of Hosts as stubble to their swords."<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The quality
of the English troops was probably superior, and their
officers more experienced; they had the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">impetus</i> of the first
rush to help them, and so far as can be judged superior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>numbers at the critical point. Naturally the struggle,
though sharp, was not long. Just as the sun rose over the
sea, "I heard Nol say," relates an officer who was in the
battle, "in the words of the Psalmist, Let God arise, and
let his enemies be scattered." The defeated portion of the
Scots fled eastwards, abandoning everything; the rest of
Leslie's army, taken in flank, and with hardly any cavalry
left, was able to make no resistance. Cromwell reported
nearly 10,000 prisoners, and 3000 of the enemy killed,
while his own loss was but small. The Scottish army was
virtually annihilated.</p>

<p>The natural consequence was that Cromwell took possession
of Edinburgh unopposed; and though he did not proceed
to further conquest, there being political dissension enough
among the Scots to render it probable that peaceable
measures would suffice, yet to all intents and purposes
Dunbar rendered him master of the Lowlands. So matters
remained through the winter, Cromwell being personally
much hampered by illness, a chill caught on an expedition
in February having developed into ague, from which he
suffered frequently, and which killed him a few years later.
The next summer, the Scottish army, with Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>
nominally at their head, took advantage of Cromwell's
moving into Fife and Perthshire to make a last desperate
venture. It is suggested, though it is hardly probable, that
Cromwell gave them the opportunity on purpose; whether
this were so or not, nothing could have been more advantageous
to the cause of the Commonwealth. The Scots
marched southwards, crossed the border at Carlisle, and
made their way through Lancashire, Cheshire, and Shropshire,
meeting with much less support from the English
population than the young king's sanguine advisers had
expected. By the time they reached Worcester Cromwell
was upon them: he had pushed his own cavalry in pursuit
as soon as he heard of their march, following himself with
the foot by the eastern route, and begging the government
to send what troops they could to meet him. The battle of
Worcester, fought on the anniversary of Dunbar, was a foregone
conclusion: Cromwell had about 30,000 against 20,000
or less, and defeated the enemy with considerable loss.
The defeated Scots, far from their own country, nearly all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>surrendered themselves prisoners. The "crowning mercy,"
as Cromwell called it, put a final end to the civil war, and
led to the complete submission of Scotland, which sent
members to all the Parliaments of the Protectorate.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>INTERMEDIATE NOTE<br />

<small>STANDING ARMIES</small></h3>

<p>In 1658, on the anniversary of his two last victories, which
was also his birthday, the great Protector died. With him
practically expired the fabric of government which he had built
up; and the nation a year and a half later recalled Charles <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>
The Protector's power had depended greatly on the army, which
had been used after his death no longer to support steady if
arbitrary government, but to further the interests of individuals
or of factions. Naturally at the Restoration there was a strong
feeling among the royalists against a standing army, though it
is only fair to the best conducted body which ever bore that
title, to point out that the many interferences of the army in public
affairs, before the abolition of the monarchy and during the
Commonwealth, were due to the strong feeling of all ranks, that
as being soldiers they were all the more bound to do their duty
as citizens, and not to the opposite tendency of soldiers to obey
their chiefs in blind indifference to every political consideration.
Everywhere except in England standing armies prevailed, and
everywhere except in England the kings were absolute. Charles
<abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> had had ample opportunities for imbibing the ideas of his
contemporaries, especially of his cousin Louis <abbr title="the Fourteenth">XIV.</abbr> He had all
the will to be absolute, but would not take trouble to make
himself so. Had it rested with him alone, he would no doubt
have been glad to maintain a standing army like his neighbours.
The cavaliers of the Restoration, however, partly from recent
and painful experience, partly imbued with the traditional
English jealousy of military force in any shape, were resolute
that there should be none. They affirmed positively the principle
for which Charles <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> had contended, that the king was the
sole and uncontrolled head of the armed forces of the state; but
they took very good care, in resettling the royal revenue, that
the king should not have the means of maintaining an army.
Charles nevertheless made a beginning; he took into his service
the regiment of General Monk, a prime agent in the Restoration,
which has since been known as the Coldstream Guards. To
them he added other regiments, one by one as occasion offered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>and his brother James followed his example. On the deposition
of the latter, Parliament affirmed in the Declaration of Right
the maxim, very dubious as a statement of historical fact, but
very rational as a principle of government, that "the maintenance
of a standing army in time of peace, without consent of
Parliament, is illegal."</p>

<p>Nevertheless the art of war had undergone such a transformation
that a standing army was a necessity unless England were to
abjure all interest in European affairs, almost a necessity if she
would preserve her independence. It was no longer possible to
extemporise efficient armies, as in the earlier middle ages: the
superior strength given by discipline, which takes time and
practice, was fully recognised. The providing of artillery, and
of ammunition, to say nothing of supplies of other kinds, was
become a complicated and expensive business, which could not
be properly carried out except under the permanent care of the
state. There was no peace till late in William <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>'s reign; and
by that time the method of voting men and money for the army
annually had been introduced. In spite of this, strong pressure
was put on William to disband the army altogether, and it was
only with great difficulty that he induced Parliament, which saw
things too exclusively from the point of view of constitutional
checks on the crown, to assent to the retention of a small force.
With the accession of Anne came the outbreak of the great
European War of the Spanish Succession, and by the end of it
the question was decided in favour of a standing army. Some
of our present regiments bear on their colours the proud names
of Marlborough's victories.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>MARLBOROUGH</small></h2>


<p>With the reign of William <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> the military history of
England entered on a new phase. Her continental wars
had hitherto been, with trifling exceptions, connected with
the claim of the English kings to the throne of France.
Henceforth she took part in nearly every European war;
and thanks to the restless energy of William <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> and to the
military genius of Marlborough, the part she played was a
leading one from the first. It has been argued that
England was wrong to concern herself with continental
quarrels, when her real interests lay elsewhere, at sea, in
North America, at a later date in India, and that she only
weakened herself for protecting these interests by intervening
in European affairs. Those who take this view leave
out of account the essential facts which governed the action
of England at the time of this new departure. She had
recently expelled her legitimate king, who had still many
partisans at home, and who found in France a ready and
most powerful ally. Louis <abbr title="the Fourteenth">XIV.</abbr> was bound to the Stuarts
by every tie of sympathy, religious, political, personal: and
though he was not the man to let his sentiments outweigh
his interest, the two so far coincided that his schemes for
domination in Europe would obviously be furthered by
weakening England through civil dissension. The English
nation as a whole was passionately attached to its church,
to its political liberties, still more perhaps to its independence
of foreigners, and saw in France the one dangerous
enemy to all three. France had other enemies, arrayed
against her for reasons which did not much concern
England, and alliance with them was an opportunity worth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>seizing. The determining motive however was not this
calculation, but outraged honour. When Louis <abbr title="the Fourteenth">XIV.</abbr>
formally recognised the son of the dying James <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> as
lawful king of England, he committed at once a crime and
a blunder: he deliberately broke his word, and insulted
England beyond endurance. Those words cost him his
supremacy in Europe, and made England henceforth a
permanent and ever weightier factor in European affairs.</p>

<p>The military reputation of England had suffered eclipse
since the days of Henry <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr>, not altogether deservedly, for
the fighting qualities of Englishmen had been conspicuous
on many fields, and yet not unnaturally. English troops
fighting for the independence of the Netherlands had done
excellent service; Cromwell's contingent allied with France
in 1658 had mainly contributed to an important victory
over Spain. But the few independent expeditions sent by
the English government to the continent had been ill
managed or ill commanded, and had failed more or less
completely. Under William <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> they showed all their
ancient stubborn valour, but luck was against them. The
defeats of Steinkirk and Landen were more glorious to the
English infantry than many a victory: the misconduct of
their allies in one case, the very superior numbers of the
French army and the great skill of its commander in the
other case, amply accounted for the failure, but still they
were defeats. The great victories of Marlborough, almost
as brilliant as Crecy or Agincourt, restored the military
credit of England, again not quite deservedly, for the armies
of Marlborough were by no means wholly English, and yet
very naturally, since the great Englishman was the real
conqueror of Louis <abbr title="the Fourteenth">XIV.</abbr> The death of William <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>, just
before war actually broke out, left Marlborough, who was
all powerful with queen Anne, the real head of the coalition
against France.</p>

<p>England thus entered on the war of the Spanish Succession
as the ally of continental powers banded together
against France, and hampered by having to act in concert
with them, as well as supported by their strength. In the
patient tact requisite for managing a body of allies with
diverging interests, and practically no bond of union
except hostility to the enemy, Marlborough was perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>never excelled. In military skill he was vastly William's
superior, being on the whole the first of an age fertile in
good generals. The weak point in his position was that it
depended on the personal favour of a stupid woman: when
his wife lost her influence over queen Anne, his political
antagonists in England found no great difficulty in bringing
about his disgrace. Marlborough was not a good man;
he was greedy of money and of power, and unscrupulous as
to the means he adopted for gaining them. As a general
however he had the virtues never too common, and almost
unknown in his age, of humanity towards the peaceful
population even of a hostile country, and of attention to the
welfare of his own soldiers. Like Wellington a century
later, he was habitually careful of the lives of his men,
though he knew how to expend them when the occasion
demanded it. Like Wellington also he never lost his
patience and coolness of judgment, either in the excitement
of battle or in dealing with troublesome allies. In fact the
two great Englishmen were conspicuously alike, at least
in their military character, though there is no real doubt
that Marlborough had the greater genius.</p>

<p>The commencement of the war was uneventful. The
king of France had taken possession of Belgium in the
name of his grandson Philip, the French claimant of the
crown of Spain, which alarmed the Dutch for their homes.
In Spain itself the French party was preponderant, but not
unopposed. Louis had every motive for standing on the
defensive. Marlborough was as yet powerless to move his
allies. It was not until the alliance of Bavaria with France
opened a road for French armies into the heart of Germany
that decisive events occurred. The chief item in the
French plans for 1704 was that Marshal Tallard should
march from the Rhine into Bavaria, where another army
under Marsin had wintered; then the two armies, combined
with the Bavarian contingent, were to advance down the
basin of the Danube. It was calculated that the Emperor,
already greatly hampered by an insurrection in Hungary,
would be unable to oppose effectual resistance, and would
purchase peace on almost any terms. If this were achieved,
the keystone of the alliance against France, the candidature
of an Austrian prince in Spain, would be removed, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>whole fabric might be expected to collapse. The plan was
well conceived: it was an instance, on the great political
scale, of acting upon the fundamental military maxim&mdash;strike
at the vital point. But for Marlborough it must
have succeeded, so far as anything can be safely predicted
in war. But for the practice, invariable in that age and
perhaps inevitable by reason of the badness of roads and
of organised supply, that all military operations should be
suspended during the winter half of the year, Marlborough
would have had no time to prepare his counter stroke.
His plan was indeed fully thought out before the winter,
in concert with the imperial general Eugene of Savoy, but
he had many obstacles to overcome before it could be
carried into operation. Even to the English cabinet he
did not venture to disclose his whole purpose, but he succeeded
in obtaining a large addition to his own army, and
increased money grants. The Dutch had but one idea, to
guard their own frontier: they would not even assent beforehand
to Marlborough's proposal, intended to conceal his real
object from friend and foe alike, that he with part of the
German contingents should operate against France from
the Moselle, while the Dutch, with the rest of the Germans,
defended the Netherlands. Marlborough was obliged to
be content with the assurance of his one firm supporter in
Holland, the Pensionary Heinsius, that consent should be
obtained when the time came. Much trouble had also
to be taken with other minor members of the confederacy,
but Marlborough attained his ostensible object of being free
to move with his own army to the Moselle.</p>

<p>Not until Marlborough with his army had reached
Coblenz, did he give any hint of his intentions, except to
the two or three persons necessarily in his confidence.
Even then he only declared to the Dutch that he found it
necessary to go further south; and they, finding that a deaf
ear was turned to their remonstrances, let Marlborough take
his own course, and even sent reinforcements after him.
The distance to be traversed, the necessity of arranging
every detail for troops moving by different routes, made his
progress necessarily slow. The French did not in the least
guess his design, but nevertheless persevered in their plan
of reinforcing the army in Bavaria, a process which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>Margrave of Baden, who commanded for the allies on the
upper Rhine, ought to have rendered much more difficult.
Not till Marlborough, ascending the Neckar, began to
penetrate the hill country that separates the basins of the
Neckar and Danube, was his real purpose apparent. He
had before then met Eugene of Savoy, who was as he hoped
to command the imperial army destined to co-operate with
him: but the Margrave of Baden, who was Eugene's senior
in rank, insisted on taking the more important part, and
leaving Eugene to command on the Rhine. Marlborough's
purpose was something like Napoleon's at the beginning of
the famous Austerlitz campaign, to concentrate his army,
reaching the Danube by various routes, near Ulm. In
Marlborough's time however Ulm was not yet an important
fortress: and the Elector abandoned it on the allies appearing
in the vicinity, and marched down the Danube to a
great intrenched camp near Dillingen. Marlborough's first
object was necessarily to secure a point of passage across
the Danube: and he determined to seize Donauwerth, a
small fortified town lower down. His zeal was quickened
by the tidings that the French army under Marshal Tallard
was on the point of marching from Strasburg to assist the
Elector. He therefore, as soon as his troops had come up
in sufficient numbers, without waiting for full concentration,
circled round Dillingen, and directed his march on Donauwerth.
The Elector divined his intention, and occupying
that town, with the hill of the Schellenberg adjoining it,
began to put in order the fortifications. Marlborough saw
the urgent necessity for haste: a couple of days' delay
might render the works on the Schellenberg unassailable, in
which case his chance of securing a bridge over the Danube
before Tallard arrived would be but small. He therefore
ordered an attack immediately on reaching the place, though
his men had had a very long march, and it was verging
towards evening.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Donauwerth stands on the north bank of the Danube,
just below the junction of a tributary, the Wernitz. The
Schellenberg, a large flat-topped hill, immediately adjoins
the town on the east. A continuous line of works existed,
passing along the brow of the hill, and extending to the
fortifications of Donauwerth on one side and down to the
Danube on the other; only the central portion however was
in a state fit for defence, though the enemy was at work on
the remainder. Marlborough arrived in person with his
cavalry before Donauwerth on the forenoon of July 2.
While waiting for the infantry to come up, he caused
bridges to be thrown over the Wernitz, and ordered a site
for a camp to be marked out, thus giving the enemy the
impression that no attack was intended, at any rate until
next day. At 6 p.m. however the pick of Marlborough's
army assailed the hill: after a long and desperate struggle,
in which the allies lost heavily, the enemy were routed, and
fled down the reverse slope to the Danube. The crush
broke down the bridge, and thousands were precipitated
into the rapid stream. Scarcely more than a quarter of the
defenders of the Schellenberg reached the Elector's camp.
As a consequence of this defeat the Elector abandoned
Donauwerth, as well as Dillingen, and retired to Augsburg,
where he shut himself up, while Marlborough ravaged
Bavaria, in the vain hope of compelling the Elector to
abandon the French alliance. Nuremberg became the
centre of Marlborough's supply system, which was elaborated
in a manner far in advance of his age; and the devastation<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
of Bavaria made him even more dependent on his magazines
than he would otherwise have been. As Tallard was now
approaching from the Rhine, with a force that Eugene was
powerless to stop, the allies found it necessary to abandon
the southern bank of the Danube. Marlborough and
Eugene persuaded the Margrave of Baden that to capture
Ingolstadt, a fortified town lower down the river, would be
a higher distinction than to await attack from the French.
They themselves united their armies at Donauwerth on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>northern bank, and marched up the river towards the enemy,
whom they found encamped beyond the Nebel, a small
tributary of the Danube.</p>

<p>The line occupied by the French and Bavarians ran
nearly north and south, and extended for about four miles.
They had naturally formed their camp on the higher ground
west of the Nebel, the course of which was marshy along the
whole front, troublesome to cross everywhere, and believed
by the French to be a much greater obstacle than it really
was. Tallard, misconstruing information that he had
received, was under the impression that Eugene's army had
not joined Marlborough, and that therefore the movement
before dawn on August 13, of which he was apprised, was a
retreat northwards. The body of cavalry which escorted
the allied generals to the Nebel, when they rode in advance
of their armies to reconnoitre, was supposed to be detached
to cover this retreat. Nothing was further from the minds
of the French generals than the expectation of being attacked
where they were. Hence they had taken no steps, as they
might easily have done, to render their front virtually unassailable.
Hence also, when the morning fog cleared off,
and discovered columns of infantry at the edge of the higher
ground which bordered the valley of the Nebel on the east,
they were in too great a hurry to do anything but form line
of battle on the ground which they already occupied.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="i_b_160"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_160.jpg" width="600" height="465" alt="Map X: Battle of Blenheim." />
</div>

<p>The Nebel emerges from the wooded uneven country to
the northwards about a mile east of Luzingen, in which
village were the Elector's head-quarters. A little lower
down, also on the right bank of the stream, is the village of
Oberglauheim. The infantry of the joint army, commanded
by the Elector and Marshal Marsin, was drawn up from
Luzingen to Oberglauheim, most of its cavalry on the right,
extending further to the south. Marshal Tallard's infantry
was most of it posted in Blenheim,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> a village close to the
Danube; his cavalry continued the line to the north till
they met Marsin's, but had a reserve of infantry behind its
centre. The artillery, which was not numerous in proportion,
was distributed at intervals. The French apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
believed the Nebel to be impassable from Oberglauheim
to Blenheim, where there were some mills on the
stream, which however they neglected to occupy: nor had
they effectually broken the bridge by which the high-road
crosses the Nebel. About Unterglauheim, a hamlet on the
left bank half-way between the two, there lies a wide piece
of swamp. During a great part of the year, or after heavy
rain, the Nebel might no doubt be a very serious obstacle,
but in August the difficulty could be overcome. Their want
of care to ascertain the truth on this point was the direct
cause of their defeat. Their dispositions had two ruinous
defects, the Nebel being passable: first, their line was
fatally weak in the centre, where for a long distance it consisted
almost entirely of cavalry: secondly, they were
posted so far back from the stream that there was room for
the enemy to form line for attack after struggling through
it. The latter error might easily have been remedied by a
short advance, but nothing was done. Tallard, it is said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>uneasy about the weakness of the centre when he saw the
enemy massing at Unterglauheim, urged Marsin to post his
reserve of infantry there; but Marsin thought, rightly as the
event showed, that his reserves were needed on the left.
Why Marshal Tallard did not withdraw from Blenheim
several of the useless thousands that crowded it, is a
question easier to ask than to answer.</p>

<p>Tallard had plenty of time to correct his dispositions, had
he known how, for the battle did not begin for several
hours after the allies came in sight. Eugene and Marlborough
had agreed that the army of the former should
constitute the right, Marlborough's the left, of the line of
battle. As their line of march had been near the Danube,
and the ground through which Eugene's columns had to
make their way was broken and wooded, it was a long time
before he was opposite Luzingen, ready to begin the action,
and Marlborough was of course obliged to wait for him.
The allied generals had discerned the defect in the French
position: a vigorous attack on the centre ought to cut the
line in half. Their plan was that Eugene should occupy
the Elector and Marsin, and that Cutts with Marlborough's
left should assail Blenheim directly, while the duke himself
undertook the decisive movement. All preparations were
duly made while Eugene was on the march: the pontoon
train was brought up, and bridges laid at intervals from
Unterglauheim downwards: the artillery was posted to
command the opposite bank: troops were pushed forward
to seize the small existing bridges near Blenheim. Except
for a not very serious cannonade, Tallard remained inactive:
he had in fact no longer any choice, unless he retreated (for
which there was no reason), after he had allowed all the
passages of the Nebel to fall into his enemy's hands. About
one o'clock came the welcome news that Eugene had
completed his march, and the battle began at once on both
flanks. Of the conflict on the right very little need be said.
The Nebel above Oberglauheim was not a real obstacle,
and Eugene attacked directly. The contest was long and
obstinate, with considerable vicissitudes: Eugene's troops,
exhausted by the long march under a hot sun, were scarcely
equal to the exertion required of them. The Elector and
Marsin held their ground till Tallard was routed, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>made an orderly retreat, but they could not spare a man to
help their colleague. Eugene's share in the action, though
not in itself successful, was a necessary and important
contribution to the victory.</p>

<p>Cutts made his attack on Blenheim with all the fury which
earned for him the nickname of the Salamander. Against
the enormous force that was massed in the village it was
scarcely possible that he should actually succeed, but he
prevented any troops from being withdrawn towards the
centre. Here also the vicissitudes of the action were great.
The first line of English infantry advanced right up to the
palisades covering the village before they fired a shot.
While vainly trying to force their way through the defences
they were suddenly charged in flank by some French
cavalry, and would have been routed but for some Hessian
cavalry, which drove back the enemy. A fierce and confused
cavalry fight followed, into which was drawn every
squadron that Cutts could command, but with no decisive
result. Meanwhile Marlborough's centre had been slowly
crossing the Nebel, covered by the artillery on the high
ground east of the stream, which approached much nearer
to it than on the French side. The passage was begun
opposite Unterglauheim by the infantry of General Churchill,
Marlborough's brother. As soon as they could begin to
form on the further bank cavalry pushed across after them,
and though charged by the first line of Tallard's cavalry,
and driven back, they were rescued by the infantry, now
fairly formed, and made good their position. As more and
more cavalry crossed the Nebel they extended to the right
towards Oberglauheim, which was held in force by the right
of Marsin's army. His cavalry fully held their own, driving
some of the Danish and Hanoverian squadrons back across
the Nebel. The infantry of Marlborough's right now began
to cross above Oberglauheim, but being promptly attacked
by the French infantry out of that village, the Irish brigade
conspicuous among them, suffered heavy loss, and would
have been defeated, but for reinforcements brought up by
Marlborough in person, which restored the balance.</p>

<p>The time was now come for Marlborough to deliver the
decisive attack. His whole army was across the stream,
and formed, the cavalry in two lines, the infantry in support
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>with intervals between the battalions, so that the squadrons
if repulsed might pass through. His artillery, advanced to
the Nebel, played upon the stationary French until the last
moment. Tallard had done, could do, nothing to meet the
coming storm, except to bring up his reserve infantry, nine
battalions, and mingle them with his cavalry. About five
o'clock the signal was given, and Marlborough led his
horsemen, some 8000 strong, up the gentle slope to the
French position. The first charge did not succeed, but
some infantry and artillery, brought up in support, took up
the action. The French did not venture to charge in their
turn, though they had ample numbers for doing so: apparently
the feebleness of Tallard was felt throughout his
army, and so the last chance was thrown away. Marlborough's
second charge completely broke the French
cavalry: the infantry intermixed with them were cut to
pieces or surrendered. Tallard in vain tried to re-form his
cavalry, in order to cover the retreat of his infantry from
Blenheim: they did not even stand another charge, but fled
in confusion, some westwards, some towards the Danube.
Detaching part of his force to pursue the former, Marlborough
drove the latter upon the river. Tallard himself,
with such of the fugitives as did not try to swim the
Danube, was compelled to surrender. Meanwhile General
Churchill, advancing in rear of the victorious cavalry, had
encircled Blenheim, where nearly 12,000 French, mostly
infantry, were still cooped up. After vain attempts to cut
their way out, the whole mass surrendered: they had been
utterly wasted by the mismanagement of their general.</p>

<p>It was the practice in Marlborough's day to count armies
by the number of battalions and squadrons; and as those
of course varied in strength, through casualties as well as
through unequal original numbers, calculations based on
them are a little uncertain. There is very fair agreement
as to the battalions and squadrons engaged on both sides,
from which it may be reasonably inferred that the allies had
about 52,000 men (9000 only being English), of which
nearly 20,000 were cavalry, and the French about 56,000,
of whom perhaps 18,000 were cavalry. In artillery the
French had a decided superiority. With this advantage,
and with a position difficult to assail effectually, they ought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>to have been well able to hold their own. The miserable
tactics of Tallard however did more than throw away this
advantage. The opinion has been expressed that 4000 men
were amply sufficient to hold Blenheim: Tallard left 13,000
there all through the day. The difference, 9000, more than
neutralised the French superiority in infantry, and left the
allies their preponderance in cavalry. Moreover Eugene
had apparently rather inferior forces to those immediately
opposed to him. Thus Marlborough was able to carry out,
to some extent at least, the cardinal maxim of bringing
superior forces to bear at the decisive point.</p>

<p>As might be inferred from the severity of the fighting, the
victory cost the allies dear, no less than 4500 killed and
7500 wounded. The French loss was enormous: fully a
quarter of their army surrendered themselves prisoners,
a still larger number were killed and wounded, or were
drowned in attempting to pass the Danube. Their camp
and nearly all their artillery fell into the hands of the
victors. Roughly speaking it may be said that Tallard's
army was annihilated: Marsin's, though it suffered severely,
made good its retreat without being disorganised.</p>

<p>Without going so far as Sir E. Creasy, who ranks Blenheim
among the fifteen decisive battles of the world, we
may still say that its moral results were even more important
than the heavy material blow inflicted on France.
For half a century France had been much more than the
first military nation in Europe. Thanks in the first place
to Turenne, but also to the organising skill of Louvois and
the engineering genius of Vauban, Louis <abbr title="the Fourteenth">XIV.</abbr> had developed
a power which, wielded as it was by a despot
steadily bent on selfish aggrandisement, had been fully a
match for coalition after coalition. A succession of great
generals carried on the traditions of Turenne: they were
pitted against enemies who on the whole were inferior in
skill, in resources, above all in homogeneity. The world
had almost come to believe in the natural and permanent
military superiority of France, and to accept Louis <abbr title="the Fourteenth">XIV.</abbr> on
his own estimate of himself. The news of Blenheim broke
the spell: the domination of France was over. Louis
himself had to admit that he was mortal: during the
remainder of the war he stood substantially on the defensive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
trying to retain or to recover territories over which he
or his grandson, the king of Spain, had some claim, but no
longer dreaming of crushing his antagonists. The power
of France was by no means broken as yet; thanks to the
difficulties inherent in working a coalition, she held
her ground for several years more, but the tide, which had
turned at Blenheim, set on the whole steadily against her.</p>

<p>Believing France to be more exhausted than she in fact
was, Marlborough hoped to achieve great things in 1705
by attacking France from the side of the Moselle. The
reluctance of his allies however kept his army so small that
he was powerless. Villars, the ablest living French general,
was opposed to him with superior forces, and with orders
to avoid a battle. After vainly trying for six weeks to find
an opportunity&mdash;a direct attack on Villars in an intrenched
position being beyond his strength&mdash;Marlborough returned
to the Netherlands, where the incapable Villeroi lay behind
a great line of almost continuous fortifications from Antwerp
to Namur. It was the fashion of the age to construct
these elaborate defences, always open to two fatal objections,
that they deprived the army holding them of all
mobility, and that they became useless if broken through
at any point. So long as the enemy was content to play
the game in the fashion that best suited the defence, or was
so hindered by bad roads and lack of subsistence that he
found it difficult to move promptly, such lines might serve
their purpose; and if from the nature of the country they
could not be turned, an enemy might deem it too hazardous
to break through them. But from Turenne onwards skilful
generals turned or pierced them whenever they seriously
tried; and Marlborough's easy success in breaking through
the French lines at what was deemed their strongest point
was a very striking proof of their inutility.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Had it not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>been for the persistent opposition of the Dutch to any
decisive action, Marlborough, advancing on Brussels, would
have fought a great battle very nearly on the field of
Waterloo. Hampered by the Dutch, he could achieve
nothing; and the year 1705, though eventful in other parts
of the vast theatre of war, ended in the Netherlands much
as it began.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="i_b_166"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_166.jpg" width="600" height="458" alt="Map XI: Battle of Ramillies." />
</div>

<p>The next year Marlborough formed a plan even more
far-reaching and audacious than that which had been
brought to so triumphant a conclusion on the field of
Blenheim. The French in northern Italy had been pressing
their enemies hard: well led by Vend√¥me, they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>gone very near to conquering Piedmont entirely. Marlborough
dreamed of marching his own army down into
Italy, and relieving the duke of Savoy. Fortunately perhaps
for his fame, he found the obstacles insurmountable,
and remained in the Netherlands,<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> where the incapable
Villeroi soon played into his hands. Believing that Marlborough's
army was not yet concentrated, and that therefore
he could fight a battle to advantage, Villeroi moved from
his intrenched camp at Louvain in the direction of Li√®ge,
not far from which city were Marlborough's head-quarters.
As a matter of fact, Marlborough was not only ready for
action, but slightly superior in numbers to Villeroi, and he
promptly moved towards the sources of the two small rivers
known as the great and little Gheet, in order that Villeroi
might not protect himself behind them, if he discovered
that he had no chance of fighting with the weight of
numbers on his side. Villeroi however was in no way
desirous of avoiding a battle, and took up a position facing
eastwards, near the source of the little Gheet.</p>

<p>The field of Ramillies is the highest ground in Brabant,
and, as is apt to be the case in flat countries where the fall
of the ground is extremely gradual, there was a great deal of
morass, in some places impassable. Immediately at the
source of the little Gheet is the small village of Ramillies;
about two miles to the north of it lies another village, Autre
Eglise, on the west of the stream, the whole course of which,
so far, is very marshy. Just south of Ramillies runs from east
to west an old Roman road known as Brunehaut's road, with
the small river Mehaigne beyond it, and between the road
and the Mehaigne, about south of Ramillies, is the village
of Tavi√®re. Villeroi's position was on the higher ground
behind the little Gheet, whence the slope to the great Gheet,
about two miles further west, is rather greater, and along
which runs the road by which Villeroi had come from
Judoigne on the great Gheet. His left was behind Autre
Eglise, his centre behind Ramillies, his right on a barrow
called the tomb of Ottomond, close above the Roman road,
with a small force thrown forward into Tavi√®re. The allied
army, marching from the east, arrived in front of this position
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>about noon (May 23, 1706). Marlborough at once saw the
opportunity which was afforded him by half of the French front
being covered by the morasses of the little Gheet. The left
was in fact almost, not quite, unassailable; but inasmuch as
the road to Judoigne, Villeroi's most direct line of retreat,
ran in rear of the left, this flank was, apart from the obstacle
of the marshes, the one which it would be most advantageous
for an enemy to attempt to turn. Hence Villeroi was easily
led by demonstrations to strengthen his left wing. Marlborough
on the other hand, secure that no counter-attack
could be effectively made on his right through the marshes,
could leave there only just troops enough to continue the
demonstration, and mass nearly his whole force towards the
left. The curve of the ground enabled him to do this
unobserved by Villeroi, who had gone in person to his left
wing, on the attack in that quarter being begun. The
French were driven out of Tavi√®re after a short struggle:
then the Dutch and German cavalry charged the famous
musketeers, who were posted nearly behind Tavi√®re. They
broke the first line, but being attacked by the second line
when in the confusion of a successful charge, were driven
back. Marlborough however came to their support, with
the cavalry which he had withdrawn from the right wing;
the musketeers were broken, outflanked, and driven in
towards the centre, while the allies occupied the tomb of
Ottomond, whence their guns could enfilade the whole
French line. Meanwhile a fierce contest had been raging
in the village of Ramillies. The French there held their
ground, though unable to repulse the assailants, until taken
in flank from the tomb of Ottomond. The battle was now
virtually won: the whole of the French centre and right
were crowded together in utter confusion. Villeroi in vain
tried to form a new line, with his left still on Autre Eglise,
thrown back nearly at a right angle to his former line. Such
an attempt, desperate at best in face of a victorious enemy,
was rendered entirely hopeless by the ground being blocked
with the baggage and ammunition waggons. Some English
troops, making their way as best they could through the
swamps, assailed the French left behind Autre Eglise, and
completed the rout. Seldom, in modern times, has a great
victory been so cheaply purchased; the total of killed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>wounded on the side of the allies fell considerably short of
4000 men. The loss of the French was naturally greater:
but the blow to them was far heavier than the figures would
imply. They lost nearly all their artillery and baggage;
and most of the army was for the time dissolved into a mob
of fugitives, among whom thousands of Walloons, unwilling
soldiers at best, took the opportunity of dispersing to their
homes. The French army, as at Vittoria, almost ceased
for a while to exist as an army, and was even longer in being
restored to efficiency. In the completeness of the disorganisation
inflicted by defeat, Ramillies has perhaps no superior
in modern times except Waterloo.</p>

<p>The victory of Ramillies was followed by the immediate
occupation of the whole of Belgium. The great inland
cities opened their gates as the defeated French withdrew;
both Antwerp and Ostend surrendered without serious resistance.
Nothing of importance was left in French hands
except the two fortresses of Mons and Namur. So severely
was the blow felt that Vend√¥me was withdrawn from Italy to
take the command against Marlborough, with the result that
prince Eugene won a great victory at Turin over Vend√¥me's
incapable successors, and drove the French entirely beyond
the Alps. In Spain also the allies met with considerable
success. Louis <abbr title="the Fourteenth">XIV.</abbr>, knowing how exhausted France was
becoming, offered terms of peace, which were rejected, not
altogether unreasonably, though in the event unfortunately,
for in 1707 the tide turned back again. The French won the
battle of Almanza, which restored their ascendency in Spain,
a battle noteworthy for the curious coincidence that the
defeated army, partly English, was commanded by a French
Huguenot noble who had entered the service of England,
while the victors were commanded by an Englishman, James
duke of Berwick, natural son of James <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, who had shared
his father's exile and entered the French service. Prince
Eugene's attempt to invade the south of France from Piedmont
failed. The lines of Stollhofen on the Rhine were
forced by the French as easily as Marlborough had surprised
the French lines in Belgium two years before, and the
imperial troops suffered a defeat. The Dutch, deeply impressed
by these disasters, would consent to no active
measures: moreover in the administration of the Spanish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>Netherlands, which had been entrusted provisionally to
Dutch hands, they had rendered themselves highly unpopular.
Thus, when in 1708 Vend√¥me, still in command,
re-entered the provinces which Villeroi had been driven to
evacuate, he was welcomed by Ghent and Bruges as a
deliverer from their new masters.</p>

<p>When the campaign of 1708 opened, Marlborough was
still waiting for his allies. His hope was that prince Eugene
with an imperial army would come from the region of the
Moselle to join him, and that in combination they would
be able to complete the conquest of the Netherlands, if
not to carry the war into France. The usual dilatoriness
of Austria gave time for Vend√¥me to take the initiative.
Having a secret understanding with French partisans in
Ghent and Bruges, Vend√¥me began by threatening first
Brussels, and then Louvain, so as to draw Marlborough to
that neighbourhood, and then suddenly marching westwards,
occupied the two great cities of the Scheldt region,
and formed the siege of Oudenarde, in order to complete
by its capture his hold on western Flanders. The alarm
of the Dutch for their own safety was great, and instead of
objecting to active measures, they were eager for a battle,
though Marlborough without Eugene was inferior to the
enemy in numbers. With great promptitude Marlborough
seized a point of passage over the river Dender, which lay
between him and the French, and which the latter had
intended to employ as the line of defence for covering the
siege. Foiled in this purpose by Marlborough's speed, the
French generals<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> thought to avoid a battle by relinquishing
for the present the siege of Oudenarde, and placing themselves
behind the Scheldt. Again Marlborough was too
quick for them: as the French were crossing that river on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>the evening of July 11, they heard that Marlborough, after a
march of almost incredible rapidity for that age, was between
them and France, and was himself crossing the Scheldt
close to Oudenarde. North of Oudenarde there is a sort of
natural amphitheatre formed by somewhat higher ground
extending in two curved lines, one of them passing close to
the city, the other some three miles further off. The space
between is, and was, cut up by hedgerows and patches of
woods, and covered with small hamlets: hence the battle
was much broken up into separate combats; moreover the
artillery could find few available positions. Vend√¥me drew
up his army along the side of this basin furthest from
Oudenarde, with a detachment occupying a hamlet some
distance in front. Cadogan, who commanded Marlborough's
vanguard, did not hesitate to attack this force, though no
supports were at the moment within reach, in order to gain
time for the main body to cross the Scheldt behind him.
As often happens, apparent rashness was in reality the most
prudent course. Cadogan would have been destroyed if
the French had brought their overwhelming numbers to
bear on him, whether he attacked or stood on the defensive:
but the bolder his attitude, the less likely they were to
discover his real weakness, and the more time there would
be for the main army to form behind him. After an
obstinate struggle, in which prince George of Hanover,
afterwards George <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, distinguished himself at the head of
some Hanoverian cavalry, Cadogan succeeded in forcing
back the French advanced guard, which Burgundy, then
in a timid mood, would not allow to be reinforced. By
the time Marlborough's army was in order of battle,
Burgundy had gone to the other extreme, and ordered an
advance, without consulting Vend√¥me, which rendered a
general action inevitable. Marlborough's troops had already
done a very severe day's work, and possibly he might not have
ventured to attack the French standing on the defensive:
but Burgundy decided the question for him. Having
thrown away, by timidity, the chance of overwhelming
Cadogan, and the chance of attacking Marlborough while
his army was still crossing the Scheldt, Burgundy now
threw away by hastiness the advantage of compelling
Marlborough's tired troops to attack a fairly strong position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Prince Eugene had come in advance of his army, and
Marlborough gave him the charge of his right wing, the
Dutch general Overkirk commanding the left. At first the
French gained some advantage, but Burgundy, finding
obstacles to pushing forward his left, ordered that portion
of his line to intrench their position, and merely hold their
ground, an error by which Marlborough immediately profited.
While Eugene, with some cavalry, held the French
left in check, Marlborough was able to bring severe
pressure to bear on the remainder of the French line, and
at the same time to outflank their right. The broken
nature of the ground rendered it impossible for the French
generals to discern clearly what was happening: when
night fell their centre and right were almost surrounded,
but the darkness enabled them to escape from being compelled
to lay down their arms, and the exhaustion of the
victors, who had fought a long battle after an extremely
long march, rendered close pursuit impossible. Nevertheless
10,000 prisoners were taken, which with the losses in
the action reduced the French to a condition of complete
inactivity. Their retreat had from the nature of the case
been to the northwards, and though they were able to take
up a safe position between Ghent and Bruges, yet they
could do nothing to guard the French frontier, which lay
open to attack.</p>

<p>Soon after the battle Eugene's army arrived, and the two
generals, instead of waiting to recover Ghent and Bruges,
resolved on carrying the war into France. The great fortress
of Lille, deemed the masterpiece of Vauban, barred the
way, and the losses of Oudenarde had been made good to
the French army. Marlborough, who had learned under
Turenne that it was not necessary to follow the traditional
routine of the age, and take every fortress before advancing
further, if it was feasible to mask it, desired to apply this
principle to Lille. Even Eugene however shrunk from so
audacious a proceeding, which would have been ruinous if
unsuccessful: and the siege of Lille was therefore undertaken
by Eugene while Marlborough covered the siege.
The transport of siege train, ammunition, and supplies requisite
for besieging a fortress large enough to contain a
garrison of 15,000 men, was for that age a task of enormous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>difficulty: the French still holding part of Flanders, it was
necessary to bring everything from Ostend, the naval
strength of Great Britain making it a matter of certainty
that all could be landed there. All difficulties were however
overcome, though a severe action had to be fought at
Wynendael to prevent the French from intercepting one important
convoy,<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and before the end of 1708 the first great
conquest of Louis <abbr title="the Fourteenth">XIV.</abbr> had been taken from him. Again
the French made proposals for peace, and would have
agreed to very unfavourable terms. But the allies demanded
that Louis should go the length of compelling his
grandson to relinquish the throne of Spain, in which country
the arms of France were in the ascendant, and the general
feeling of the nation was favourable to the French claimant
of the crown. Marlborough has been blamed for this, but
apparently without reason: his own personal advantage lay
in continuing the war, and party hatred was ready to impute
to him any baseness. The utmost that can be said against
him, or the English government, in the matter is, that they
did not insist on this demand being abandoned.</p>

<p>Rather than submit to this ignominy, Louis <abbr title="the Fourteenth">XIV.</abbr> for
the first time in his life appealed to the patriotism of his
people, who responded zealously. Villars, the only French
general of high repute whom Marlborough had not yet defeated,
was placed in command, in spite of his being not
unreasonably disliked at court. Villars was undeniably the
ablest French soldier living, and fully justified the confidence
somewhat tardily placed in him. Standing at first
on the defensive, he waited till the allies advanced to besiege
Mons, the capital of Hainault, which now that Lille
had fallen was the chief defence of the French frontier.
He was unable to prevent them from forming the siege, but
soon approached with a large army, in order if possible to
relieve the place. Whether Villars would have attacked, if
the allies had taken up a defensive position to cover the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>siege, may perhaps be doubted. Whether Marlborough was
really guilty of fighting a great battle against his military
judgment, in the hope of supporting by another victory his
failing influence at home, may be doubted also. If Marlborough
had had his way, he would have attacked Villars
immediately on his arrival in the neighbourhood of Mons,
without allowing time for him to strengthen his position;
but he unfortunately yielded to Eugene's wish that approaching
reinforcements should be waited for, and so
enabled Villars thoroughly to intrench a position very strong
by nature. On September 11, 1709, was fought the battle
of Malplaquet, the last, the least creditable, and the most
costly of all Marlborough's victories. It consisted mainly
in a direct attack on the French army posted on a wooded
ridge, their centre occupying the only gap in the woods.
By sheer hard fighting the allies were just able to compel
the enemy to abandon their position, but the French retired
in perfect order, the victors gaining nothing but the battle-field,
while their losses far exceeded those of the French.
So frightful was the slaughter that public feeling in England
blamed Marlborough for the losses incurred far more than
it rejoiced in the victory. Not even the capture of Mons,
which resulted from the failure of Villars' attempt to relieve
it, atoned for what was described as the needless butchery
of Malplaquet.</p>

<p>The rest of the war offers no features of interest. The
Tories in England succeeded in gaining Anne's favour, and
in overthrowing Marlborough, and they inclined to peace
both because their great opponent had all the glory of the
war, and also because the Jacobite sympathies of many of
them disposed them favourably towards France, the mainstay
of the Jacobite cause. Presently the Austrian claimant
of the crown of Spain succeeded, by his brother's unexpected
death, to the Empire, and to the whole Austrian
dominions. This changed the whole situation, and fully
justified the English government in seeking peace, though
nothing could justify their conduct towards their allies.
Thanks to political intrigues mainly, but partly also to his
own faults of a non-military kind, the career of the greatest
genius among English generals had a feeble and almost
ignominious close.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>INTERMEDIATE NOTE<br />

<small>LINE <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">VERSUS</i> COLUMN</small></h3>

<p>The order of battle (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acies</i>) has always been in some sense a
line, for a permanent and obvious reason. None but those who
are in front can fight, and the natural desire is to encounter the
enemy with as great strength as possible. What will be the
depth of the formation must depend upon many considerations,
among which the nature of the weapons of the period is the
most obvious, though others, such as the training of the men and
their national traditions, are far from unimportant. A body of
men drawn up more than four deep could hardly however be
called a line. Similarly the order of march (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agmen</i>) has always
been the converse of the order of battle: four men abreast
require a fairly wide road. It is not necessary that a whole
army shall move by a single road, in modern times they do not.
But until armies grew very large it was not needful that they
should separate: until roads grew plentiful and maps were
available it was not safe, unless where no collision with the
enemy was possible.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acies</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agmen</i> are then, in their simplest form, the same
thing looked at from two different points of view. The thin
line drawn up to face the enemy may be imagined turning to
the right or left and marching off. Of course it is not meant to
be implied that such, and such only, were actually the primitive
methods. Just as a mechanical problem is solved by assuming
the absence of friction, a condition which in fact can never be
realised, and correcting the result afterwards on account of friction,
so one may for the moment leave out of sight all subsidiary
things, in order to bring out in its simplicity the fundamental
idea of an order of battle. Historically, no doubt, by the time
men had advanced far enough to comprehend the value of
combining to form a line, they had attained also to diversity of
weapons, which would tend at once to interfere with this bare
simplicity. Every fresh change, especially the introduction of
war-chariots or of horse-soldiers, would further complicate the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acies</i>. So too, as soon as an army carries anything with it, the
simple idea of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agmen</i> is encroached on. Nevertheless both
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acies</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agmen</i> are rooted, so to speak, in the nature of things:
the former can be traced in every battle, the latter in every
march.</p>

<p>Some of the departures from the principle of the line are
rather apparent than real. A reserve is no exception, even
when it becomes a whole second, or even third line: for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>reserve ex <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hypothesi</i> is not fighting: when it is wanted to fight
it is brought up to the front, and ceases to be in reserve. Foot-soldiers
standing on the defensive, especially as against horsemen,
present the largest amount of front in the safest way by
forming a closed figure, the ring of the Northmen and of the
Scots, or the familiar square of modern infantry in the days
before the rifle. Nevertheless modifications are liable to be
introduced, so to speak, from both sides. The order of battle
is deepened, with the idea of giving greater impetus to a charge,
from the weight of men behind backing up the front ranks.
Epaminondas, using this device unexpectedly at Leuctra,
defeated the Spartans, whose superior discipline and physique
made them invincible so long as both sides used the same
formation. His success led to the adoption of the Macedonian
phalanx, and the abandonment of the line for the time being,
until the Romans reverted successfully to the natural order.
The order of march, for a real journey, cannot well be modified,
because roads do not allow it. But for short marches, over open
ground, there was much to be gained by massing men more
closely together. They could hear orders better, and could be
moved in any direction with more ease and precision. Hence
arose the column, which is strictly speaking a series of short
lines ranged one behind the other, and which, as military evolutions
were developed, became the natural formation for
man&oelig;uvring, as distinguished from fighting. Then obvious
convenience would suggest keeping the troops as long as possible
in the more handy formation of columns, even on the field of
battle. Until the actual shock was impending, it was better to
leave them so formed that they could be readily moved if necessary
to another part of the field. Until artillery became really
effective, the risk of increased loss, from cannon-balls passing
through a solid body, instead of a line, was not very serious.
Until the bayonet was introduced, the necessity for pikemen and
musketeers acting together would tend to make deep formations,
which are columns without their mobility, a virtual necessity.
Thus in more ways than one column came to be regarded as the
ordinary formation, line as the exception. And generals were
led by the real convenience of mobility and facility of command,
perhaps also by other calculations, to make attacks in column,
with or without the intention of extending into line after the
enemy's front had been pierced.</p>

<p>No words are required to show that troops armed with the
short-range musket and bayonet, fighting against opponents
similarly armed, are more effective in proportion as their depth
can be safely reduced. More men can fire on the enemy, fewer
are liable to be hit by the hostile bullets. This holds good alike
for attack and for defence, and is indeed so obvious that when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>one finds great masters of the art of war adopting the column as
the formation for attack, one begins to look for some latent flaw
in the reasoning. There is none however from the material
point of view: the real or supposed advantage of the column is
moral only. When a mass of men formed in a deep column
advances to attack a line, the front ranks of the column have the
(imaginary) support of the ranks behind them. The imagination
of the line is meant to be impressed by the spectacle of the
heavy mass about to impinge on it. Both notions are really
baseless: the line has no assailants except the front ranks of the
column, who not only are not helped by those behind, but become
the targets for the concentrated fire of the line. But imagination
is a very real force in war, as in other human affairs: the
generals who have formed heavy columns for attack, need not
be supposed to have made a gross blunder: they may have
adopted the method best suited to the qualities and traditions
of their men. All that can fairly be concluded is that the line is
enormously more effective for those who can bear the strain.
And England may be congratulated alike on having the requisite
toughness of material, and on having had generals who knew
how to utilise it.</p>

<p>From the beginning of English history, as the foregoing pages
have shown, the English modes of fighting have always led to
the adoption of a thin line. Harold's house-carls must have
stood in a single rank. The archers of Crecy cannot have been
in more than two. The dismounted men-at-arms were drawn
up, we are told on one or two occasions, four deep: and seeing
that they had to sustain the momentum of mailed horsemen
charging, they could not well have had less. The bodily
strength and toughness of the English race, perhaps their lack
of imagination, qualified them to bear the shock of battle well:
and the habit of victory engendered a confidence of superiority,
which was doubtless arrogant, but was also calculated to realise
the expectation. Thus the national qualities and traditions were
favourable to the adoption in later ages of a thinner line than
other nations saw their way to employ.</p>

<p>The evidence of the drill books seems to be clear that in
England the fighting formation in the seventeenth century was
three deep, that in the war of American independence the
practice of skirmishing in two ranks began, and that in the
Peninsula the formation in two ranks for all fighting was finally
adopted. A thinner line still is to all intents and purposes
impossible. Whether the adoption of this system was the
carrying out in full of the fundamental theory of the line, namely
that it is the mode in which the largest proportion of force can
be brought to bear on the enemy at once, or was suggested by
virtual necessity, it is hard to tell. Given two very unequal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>forces opposed to each other, it is obvious that the smaller can
form an order of battle tolerably equal to the larger only by
making its line very thin. It is also obvious that this can be
done safely only if the men are not to be daunted by feeling the
lack of support. These conditions existed, in extreme form, in
the early English wars in India. The soldiers of Clive and
Coote, whether English or sepoys, were infinitely superior in
discipline and equipment, if not in courage, to their enemies, and
they were outnumbered many times over. It is quite possible
that the first impulse to the two-deep formation came from
India. However this may be, it is certain that England, and
England alone, adopted a century ago the line of two ranks
only; it seems to be also the case that at a much earlier period
it was the English practice to fight in line, while other nations
made more use of the column. And it is certain too that
England gained enormously by being able to do so. The whole
Peninsular war forms a commentary on this text, with Waterloo
for a crowning lesson.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</small></h2>


<p>The peace of Utrecht left England in the very front
rank of European powers, bound by treaty obligations to
maintain the settlement then made, and taught by many
victories to assume that her intervention would be effective.
Moreover a new influence tended in the same direction:
her kings had through their Hanoverian dominions a
personal interest in continental affairs, and naturally tried
to obtain English support in Hanoverian quarrels. Naturally
also France was permanently jealous of the power which
had destroyed her dream of naval supremacy, and had
played the leading part in humbling Louis <abbr title="the Fourteenth">XIV.</abbr> Thus it
was to be expected that England would be involved more
or less in most European wars, and also that she would
habitually have France as her antagonist. She had private
troubles in addition, in the shape of the Jacobite rebellion
of 1745 and the revolt of the American colonies. The former
could hardly have taken place had England not been at
war with France: the latter succeeded very largely because
France and the other European opponents of England
seized the opportunity to coalesce against her. France and
England were in truth pitted against each other all the
world over. In North America they began the rivalry of
the eighteenth century on fairly equal terms, so far as that
continent was concerned. But the naval and commercial
superiority of Great Britain, which grew more and more
pronounced as time passed, insured her ultimate triumph
in America in spite of all that France could do; while
nearer home England found her advantage in supporting
with money and men the continental enemies of her rival.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>
<p>Nevertheless nearly thirty years elapsed after the peace
of Utrecht before England again sent an army to the
continent. At first temporary considerations led the
governments of George <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> and the regent Orleans, threatened
by similar dangers at home, to act in concert abroad.
A little later Walpole came into power, and his chief aim
was the maintenance of peace, in order that the new
dynasty might have time to take root. During this period
of peace the army lost the efficiency which Marlborough
had given it. Political corruption undermined every department
of the public service. The traditional jealousy
of the existence of a standing army exhibited itself in
the form of cutting down the numbers, and neglecting the
equipment, of the army which was still kept in existence.
The officers, who owed their rank to money or court
favour, trained neither themselves nor their men. The
only thing which saved England from disgrace in battle
after battle was the stolid courage which never knows when
it is beaten. This is to all appearance a national characteristic:
in other words it is a quality found in most Englishmen,
developed in them by the unconscious influence of
race, of tradition, of we know not what, but not the outcome
of conscious and deliberate training. English soldiers
might have incompetent leaders, be ill-supported by their
allies, be even placed under foreign generals because the
government could find no competent Englishman to command.
In spite of every discouragement they exhibited
time after time the same obstinate valour, and on the
distant battle-fields of India, where the good fortune of
England brought men like Clive and Coote to the front,
they accomplished feats worthy to rank with the greatest
achievements of the Black Prince or Marlborough.</p>

<p>When the war of the Austrian Succession broke out, a
strong feeling arose in England in favour of Maria Theresa,
who was being deprived by a league of European powers
of rights which they had all solemnly bound themselves to
maintain. France was her chief enemy, and this doubtless
quickened English zeal, though it was not until many
months after an army largely English, under George <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> in
person, had won a victory which drove the French out of
Germany, that war was formally declared by France. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>two years both English and French had been nominally
acting only as auxiliaries to their respective German allies.
The battle of Dettingen (June 27, 1743), the last in which an
English king has taken part, was not creditable to the skill
of either party. The Anglo-Austrian army, in attempting
a bold stroke, allowed itself to be so shut in by a very
superior French force that its surrender seemed almost
inevitable. Mismanagement on the French side brought
on a battle under conditions which neutralised this advantage;
and they were badly defeated, though the allies,
content with rescue from their perilous position, did not
press the pursuit.</p>

<p>Two years later (May 11, 1745) the English contingent
played a distinguished part in the bloody battle of Fontenoy,
fought in the hope of raising the siege of Tournay. The
task was almost hopeless, for Marshal Saxe with superior
numbers occupied a strong intrenched position, and the
allies not only had no general comparable to Saxe, but were
not even under the real command of any one. The duke
of Cumberland, son of George <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, was nominal commander-in-chief
by virtue of his rank, but he had practically no
authority over his Austrian and Dutch colleagues. The
idea of the battle was of medi√¶val simplicity, direct attack
all along the line. The Austrians and Dutch could make
no impression on the French right: Cumberland, after more
than one unsuccessful attack on their left, formed most
part of his British and Hanoverian infantry into a single
heavy column 14,000 strong, which broke through the left
centre of the hostile line, bearing down all opposition,
though suffering enormous loss. If Cumberland had been
properly supported at the critical moment, a victory might
have been won, but his colleagues would not stir; and his
column had to retire under a heavy cannonade, and fiercely
assailed in flank by the Irish troops in the French service.
They left 4000 dead behind them, but their ranks remained
unbroken, and the cavalry ultimately was able to cover an
orderly retreat.</p>

<p>The most noteworthy fact about Fontenoy is that on that
day the English infantry was led to attack in column,
instead of in line. It was very natural that Cumberland
should do so under the circumstances; English military
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>science was at a low ebb, and he might well suppose that
the methods of the continent were superior. His previous
efforts, apparently made in line, had been foiled: it was
most natural, since his obstinate courage refused to accept
failure as his allies were doing, that he should try another
formation. The attack in column was up to a certain point
successful, but it would be rash to infer that therefore the
column was preferable. The movement of retreat was made
under every condition calculated to demoralise soldiers,
frightful losses in their own ranks, inability to strike at the
enemy in return, refusal of their allies to support them.
Troops capable of maintaining their formation with perfect
steadiness under such a trial were capable of anything. An
attack made by them in line, pressed home with equal
determination, would have been quite as likely to succeed,
would have cost the enemy more, and themselves much
less.</p>

<p>The Jacobite rebellion of 1745, which involved the last
fighting that has taken place on British soil, is chiefly
remembered because of the romantic interest in the Stuart
cause created more than half a century later by the genius
of Sir Walter Scott. In the home of their race the Stuarts
aroused much chivalrous loyalty, though never was a noble
sentiment wasted on more unworthy objects. The advance
into England can plausibly be described as a piece of
brilliant daring, which went very near to being rewarded
with success: but it is perfectly obvious that no other
policy offered the remotest chance of succeeding, and equally
certain, though perhaps less obvious, that failure was always
inevitable. England seemed indifferent: Jacobite zeal was
almost dead, and the feeling toward the house of Hanover
had not risen above passive acquiescence. Still the apathy
was largely superficial: the panic in London, when it was
known that the Highlanders were in Derbyshire, is a
grotesque proof of this. If the English nation had ever
seriously believed that there was a probability of a Roman
Catholic king, backed by the strong favour of France,
mounting the throne, the chances of the Pretender would
have vanished in a moment.</p>

<p>The battles fought during the rebellion, small as they
were, point with some force more than one military lesson.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>At Preston Pans the disgraceful panic flight of the English
cavalry left the infantry exposed without support, and with
both flanks uncovered, to the sudden rush of the Highlanders.
Armed with clumsy muskets which required so
long to load that they had no time to deliver a second
volley, and with bayonets slow and awkward to fix, they
were practically unarmed against the onset of brave men
armed in a manner most effective at close quarters. It was
no wonder that they imitated the dragoons and took to
flight, though with more excuse. At Falkirk General Hawley,
grossly incompetent and careless, allowed his army to be
surprised: the Jacobites, well handled, and having the
further fortune of being able to attack while wind and rain
were blinding the enemy, gained a well-deserved victory.
At Culloden (April 16, 1746) the Jacobite bubble finally
burst. The duke of Cumberland understood his business,
and had in his favour superior numbers, and more efficient
artillery. The rebels, half starving, had no choice but to
fight or disperse. Unable to bear the fire of Cumberland's
guns, which instead of being massed were distributed along
the front line, two in each interval between regiments, the
Highlanders of the right and centre charged desperately
home. In spite of Cumberland's ingenious order that his
men should thrust with the bayonet each at the enemy to
his right, so as to avoid the Highland targets, they succeeded
in breaking the front line. The second line however received
them with a crushing fire which drove them back in
utter rout. The Macdonalds on the left had hung back,
sulky at being refused their traditional post on the right:
but this only made the difference that a few less fell on
both sides. Against discipline and steadiness they had
never had a chance of victory.</p>

<p>The treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, 1748, put an end to the
European war, and made formal peace between England
and France. The differences between the two great rivals
outside Europe were however in no way removed: it can
scarcely be said that in India or America the peace was
ever more than nominal. The French attempt to connect
their possessions in Canada with Louisiana gave the English
colonies no option but armed resistance, unless they were
prepared to abandon all prospect of extension westwards.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>For some time the contest was carried on in the region of
the Ohio, without involving a formal breach between the
two nations. In 1756 however, a coalition was formed
between Austria, France, Russia, and Saxony for the dismemberment
of the Prussian monarchy, which had risen to
considerable power under Frederick the Great. Great
Britain naturally allied herself with the enemy of France,
and English subsidies were of great value to Frederick in
his skilful and substantially successful resistance to enormous
odds. The part taken by English arms in the war in Germany
was not very important. The duke of Cumberland's
blundering campaign, which ended in the convention of
Closterseven, was made with Hanoverian and other German
troops. More than one expedition against the French coast
proved practically abortive. In 1759 however British troops
had a conspicuous share in the important victory of Minden.</p>

<p>Marshal Contades with a French army of about 45,000
men held Minden, which is situated on the left bank of the
Weser, just below the junction of a small tributary, the
Wastau. On the approach of Ferdinand of Brunswick with
a slightly inferior army, mainly German, but including six
regiments of British infantry and some cavalry, Contades
determined to give him battle. Accordingly during the
night of July 31 he crossed the Wastau, over which he had
constructed several bridges, his camp having been hitherto
on the south of it, and formed in order of battle two or
three miles north and west of Minden, with the left resting
on the village of Hahlen, the right extending to the Weser.
His own immediate command, about two-thirds of the
whole, faced nearly north-west; and for a very inadequate
reason his cavalry was massed in the centre, the infantry on the
wings, the artillery being as then usual distributed along the
front. The duke of Broglie's command, which had hitherto
been acting separately, formed the right of the army, at an
angle to Contades' line, facing northwards. Prince Ferdinand,
advancing also before day-break, placed his army on
an arc corresponding to the French, but necessarily somewhat
longer, and therefore, as his numbers were less, in
decidedly less dense formation. Contades' plan of battle
was that Broglie should begin the action by attacking Ferdinand's
left wing, and after driving it off, should turn and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>take the German centre in flank, while he himself attacked
it in front. Broglie's opening cannonade however made no
impression on the enemy, and he had to content himself
with holding his ground. Prince Ferdinand's army was
drawn up in a more rational fashion. On his extreme right
was a mass of cavalry, under Lord George Sackville the
English general: and another body of cavalry faced the
immediate right of Contades, while the space between was
filled by infantry in two lines, with guns at intervals. A
detachment sent forward to drive the French out of Hahlen,
in order to clear the way for the artillery to advance, had
not yet succeeded in its task, when the English regiments,
which formed the right of the infantry line, began to advance.
Ferdinand had not intended this, some order seems to have
been misunderstood; but the advance once begun could
not be checked. Supported by some Hanoverian regiments,
the British marched in line, as if on parade, towards the
left centre of the French, regardless of the fire poured on
them by two batteries, one on each flank. The first line of
the French, here entirely cavalry, attacked them in vain:
but their continued advance exposed them to flanking fire
from the infantry of the French left. Prince Ferdinand sent
repeated orders to Lord George Sackville to bring forward
his cavalry, and take some of the pressure off the infantry;
but he remained obstinately inactive. Had he obeyed
orders, the victory would have been decisive and complete:
the whole French army must apparently have been driven
into the Weser. Charge after charge was delivered upon
the English, rather ill combined, with the result that the
whole of the splendid French cavalry was completely
defeated, and driven off the field, with a loss of 1700 men.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the action had been better sustained on
Contades' right; but the defeat of his centre involved the
retreat of his whole army. Covered by Broglie's corps,
which had not been seriously engaged, the French retired
on their bridges, and succeeded in crossing the Wastau, not
without sustaining additional losses from the British artillery,
which was boldly and skilfully pressed forward as the French
left gave way. Broglie made good his retreat into Minden,
but not without losing a whole brigade, which was surrounded
and had to surrender. The French loss was 7000 men, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>of the allies about 2600, of which half fell on the six English
regiments, the 12th, 20th, 23rd, 25th, 37th, and 51st, which
to this day bear the name of Minden on their colours. But
for the English general, the result would have been like that
of Friedland, the annihilation or surrender of the whole
hostile army, except the few who might succeed in crossing
a bridgeless river. Lord George Sackville's military career
ended on that day, as well it might: a fortunate accession
to property enabled him to enter political life under a new
name, but it can hardly be said that the achievements of
Lord George Germaine were much more distinguished in the
arena of politics than those of his former self on the battle-field.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously with Minden, occurred the brilliant
capture of Quebec by Wolfe, which meant the conquest of
Canada. Pitt, who knew how to select and to appreciate a
capable man, chose Wolfe, who was only a colonel, to conduct
the most difficult part of a complicated scheme for
invading Canada. One force was to strike at Niagara,
another was to move by way of Lake Champlain, the third
was to go in ships up the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence and assail the capital.
Separated as these forces were by long distances, and
opposed by the French in adequate numbers, they could
not possibly act in close concert. It may suffice to say of
the two expeditions which started by land from the territory
of the colonies, that they were conducted in a steady
methodical way, and achieved a fair amount of success.
Their real importance lay in their distracting the councils
of the French, and preventing Wolfe from being overwhelmed.
Even as it was, Wolfe was enormously overmatched
so far as mere numbers were concerned; but his
troops if few were of excellent quality, whereas opposed to
him were still fewer French regulars, the Canadian militia,
for which he had a well-grounded contempt, forming the
bulk of the army that held Quebec. There was some
little delay, after Wolfe had reached Louisburg, before
the expedition could set sail up the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence. The
French knew of his coming, and had made all possible preparations;
but as time went on, they persuaded themselves
that their enemy would not venture to attempt the dangerous
navigation of the river. The English admiral, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a><br /><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>managed to secure pilots: some of his captains even scoffed
at the difficulty, and piloted themselves. Without any
accident, the whole English fleet passed up the tortuous
channel, and landed Wolfe's army opposite Quebec. As the
governor of the province wrote home to the French minister,
"the enemy passed sixty ships of war where we hardly dared
risk a vessel of a hundred tons."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_b_188"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_188.jpg" width="400" height="591" alt="Map XII: Quebec." />
</div>

<p>Quebec stands facing eastwards down the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence
at the end of a long strip of high ground, which above
Quebec is about a mile wide, with extremely steep descent
both southwards to the river bank, and northwards to the
plain through which the river <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Charles winds, to fall into
the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence beside Quebec. Seven or eight miles
below the mouth of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Charles, on the north bank, is a
narrow and deep ravine, into which the river Montmorenci
tumbles in the celebrated falls. Between the two the ground
is fairly flat, but high above the level of the river, which is
edged by slopes too steep to be climbed except at a few
spots. Along this shore the French general Montcalm,
with the concurrence of the governor Vaudreuil, thought fit
to encamp his army, and to line the whole bank with fortifications.
He doubtless thought to crush the English fleet
if it attempted to pass up: but as the river is there two or
three miles wide, the ships passed to and fro as they pleased,
and whenever it suited Wolfe's purpose gave the shore
batteries and camp a very unpleasant time. Immediately
under Quebec the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence is but a mile wide, and the
south bank forms a great curve known as Point Levi, immediately
below which, separated from it by a deep inlet,
and opposite the mouth of the Montmorenci, is a long
stretch of low ground called the Isle of Orleans. Wolfe
arrived before Quebec on June 26, without having encountered
any opposition, and landed his forces on the Isle of
Orleans. Montcalm had decided on the prudent course:
he believed that he had made Quebec unassailable, and he
calculated that by avoiding battle and simply standing on
the defensive, he would compel the English, after expending
their resources, to retreat baffled. He only omitted one
element from his calculation, the perfect mobility given to
Wolfe by the British ships. There were French vessels in
the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence, but very inferior in force to the English:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>and they had been sent, with disastrous caution, far up the
river for safety, and their crews withdrawn to aid in the
defence of Quebec. Wolfe consequently could move his
troops exactly as he pleased, to or from any part of either
bank not actually occupied by the French, and they were
powerless even to impede his movements. The only possible
device open to the French was to attempt to destroy
the fleet with fire-ships: this was tried more than once, but
the English sailors on each occasion grappled the flaming
masses, towed them ashore, and left them to burn themselves
out innocuous.</p>

<p>Wolfe's first move was to occupy Point Levi, and erect
batteries there, from which he could bombard the city. His
next was to occupy the ground just east of the mouth of the
Montmorenci, in the hope of being able to cross that stream
higher up and attack the main French camp in rear. There
was no real risk in dividing his army, assuming that the
force on the north bank of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence was sufficiently
large, for the detachments on the south bank were inaccessible
to the French. On July 18, some ships ran past the
batteries of Quebec, a feat which the French commanders
had deemed impossible. Boats were dragged overland
behind Point Levi, and launched on the river above. It
became necessary to detach troops to guard the long line of
cliffs extending for many miles above Quebec. Still Montcalm
could not be brought to risk anything by a counter
stroke: a direct attack on his camp seemed hopelessly rash,
but there was apparently no alternative. On July 31 an
attempt was made to scale the heights a little west of the
Montmorenci, which failed: the over-eagerness of the detachment
ordered to lead the attack spoiled what little
chance there may have been, but success was hardly possible.
Then Wolfe fell ill, and for weeks nothing was done. When
he recovered, if it can be called recovery for an acute attack
of a mortal disease to pass away, he turned his attention in
earnest to the river above Quebec. Ship after ship ran the
gauntlet of the batteries, and troops were pushed up the
southern bank. A large French force under Bougainville
had to be employed to guard, as best they could, the long
line of cliffs on the opposite shore. Several attempts at
landing were made, without achieving much except wearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>out the French troops with incessant marching to and fro,
while the English, conveyed rapidly in boats, could threaten
any point they pleased. Obviously however, it was one
thing to land a party for a mere raid; it was far more difficult,
under the conditions, to land the whole army, small as
it was, and establish it on the high ground west of Quebec.
Before he had seen the place, Wolfe had hoped to attack
the city in this way: now, after proving that no other course
was feasible, he reverted to this desperate venture.</p>

<p>When Wolfe evacuated his camp by the Montmorenci,
taking the soldiers on ship-board, the natural hope of the
French was that this step was preparatory to retreat. They
knew, or thought they knew, that the English admiral was
anxious to be gone, before the season was too far advanced.
Nor could they understand the meaning of his taking the
ships up the river: they believed the north bank, guarded
as it was, to be unassailable. Wolfe however had fully
resolved on making the attempt; his great anxiety was to
be fit to lead in person, since he would not devolve on any
one else the responsibility of probable failure. "I know
perfectly well you cannot cure me," he said to his physician:
"but pray make me up so that I may be without pain for a
few days, and able to do my duty." After reconnoitring the
whole shore carefully, he decided on trying to ascend at the
spot now known as Wolfe's Cove, about a mile and a half
above Quebec. By so doing he would compel Montcalm,
who had of course ready access to the city across the mouth
of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Charles, to choose between fighting a battle to
save Quebec and being shut up in the city, already beginning
to starve. It is true that he would have in his rear the
considerable force under Bougainville, but he knew that his
own troops were far superior in quality to most part of the
French, and relied on being able to keep Bougainville at
bay. After all, if the risk was great, the prize was great
also, and the only alternative was to submit to total failure.</p>

<p>For several days the ships were allowed to drift up and
down with the tide, while boats seemed to be looking for
points of landing, and Bougainville's men were kept incessantly
on the move. Every man that could be spared,
without evacuating the necessary stations at Point Levi and
the Isle of Orleans, was brought on board the vessels: even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>then, the total did not reach 5000. At two a.m. on Sept.
13, the tide served, and the boats conveying the infantry
who were to land dropped down the river, the other vessels
following gradually. As they neared the chosen spot, they
were challenged from a French post on the heights: an
officer promptly replied in French, and the enemy, who
were expecting some provision boats to steal down in the
night, were satisfied. Fortune was favourable at the landing-place:
the officer commanding the post above was negligent,
and a regiment which ought to have been encamped on the
plateau near at hand had been by mistake placed at some
distance. The ascent was made without opposition, and
before daylight Wolfe's little army, all infantry from the
nature of the case, was safe on the plateau. A regiment
was left to hold the landing-place, and another was pushed
out to the rear to guard against the chance of attack from
Bougainville. Thus the total force available for the actual
battle was but 3600 men. As soon as there was light
enough, Wolfe formed his line facing Quebec, about a mile
from the city. English ships had been cannonading Montcalm's
lines until after nightfall, and seeming to threaten a
landing. When at daybreak Montcalm heard firing from
above Quebec, he rode in that direction, caught sight of the
red-coats on the plateau, and hastily ordered up all the
troops that were within reach. By about ten o'clock the
French also were in order of battle, and advanced to the
attack. Two field-guns had by this time been dragged up
from the landing-place; Montcalm had also obtained three
from the citadel: but substantially it was a battle of infantry
only, with everything to favour the English. Montcalm had
not waited to bring up all possible force, and engaged with
numbers little greater than Wolfe's, of by no means uniformly
good quality. The English line had been long formed, and
the men quietly halted in perfect order; the French advanced
hastily, not in the best order. Wolfe waited till the enemy
were within forty yards: then a volley along the whole line
broke the attacking column to pieces. The English charged,
and all was over. "As Wolfe led on his men he was struck
first by one bullet, then by another, but still held on his
way. A third pierced his breast and he fell. He was
carried to the rear, and asked if he would have a surgeon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>'There's no need,' he answered, 'it's all over with me.'
A moment after one of them cried out, 'They run: see how
they run.' 'Who run?' Wolfe demanded, like a man roused
from sleep. 'The enemy, sir: egad, they give way everywhere.'
'Go, one of you, to Colonel Burton,' returned
the dying man; 'tell him to march Webb's regiment down
to Charles river, to cut off their retreat from the bridge.'
Then, turning on his side, he murmured, 'Now God be
praised, I will die in peace:' and in a few moments his
gallant soul had fled."<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Montcalm was mortally wounded in the retreat, and there
was no one to replace him. Total as the French defeat had
been on the field, they had still at least double the English
force, and Quebec was untaken. But despondent counsels
prevailed, the city capitulated, and when peace came, France
had to purchase it by surrendering her one great colony;
England was left mistress of North America. Well may
Parkman say, "Measured by the numbers engaged, the
battle of Quebec was but a heavy skirmish: measured by
results, it was one of the great battles of the world."</p>

<p>The operations before Quebec furnish an admirable
illustration, on a small scale, of what sea power can do to
render assistance to land warfare. The French were forced
not only to watch, but to occupy, many miles of shore; the
English could post themselves where they pleased on the
opposite bank in perfect security, and could move hither
and thither when they desired it. They could cannonade
from the water any portion of the French shore, and their
enemies could never feel safe at any point against attack at
any moment. The ships practically multiplied two or threefold
the little force at Wolfe's disposal. Wolfe might grow
sick at heart at seeing no opening for decisive action, his
men might grow weary of delay, but they had no hardships
to suffer. The French position was extraordinarily strong,
and Montcalm steadily patient in giving his opponent no
opportunity. Wolfe was obviously right in exhausting all
other possibilities before trying a venture which if unsuccessful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
would have been fatal; but when he did try it, his
naval strength enabled him to do so with every chance in
his favour which the situation allowed.</p>


<p class="mt2">Of the war of American independence it does not enter
into my plan to write. A detailed narrative would only ring
the changes on two or three simple themes. Disciplined
troops might be expected, unless grossly ill-commanded, to
have the advantage over the colonists. The vast extent of
the country made it impossible for the small British armies
effectually to occupy more than isolated bits. The generals
sent out from England were some of them incompetent,
some neglectful, all face to face with a task beyond their
strength. Washington, who held the chief control of the
colonial forces, did his work with great skill and most
admirable patience, and he was on the whole fortunate in
his subordinates. Had not France intervened, the war
might very probably have been much longer protracted.
But when France and Spain and Holland had all joined in
the war, the British navy was no longer dominant in the
Atlantic; supplies, reinforcements, communications generally,
ceased to reach America with ease and certainty, and
the case became hopeless. British credit was restored,
to say the least, by the great naval victory of Rodney in
the West Indies, and by the total failure of the French
and Spaniards to make any impression on Gibraltar; but
the American colonies had none the less achieved their
independence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>THE PENINSULA<br />

PART I.&mdash;DEFENSIVE</small></h2>


<p>The French Revolution gave the signal for a long series
of wars, in which France, thanks to the great military genius
of Napoleon, got the better of all the nations of Europe,
except England. At the end of the year 1807 Napoleon
was at the height of his power; all central Europe was at
his feet, and he had concluded with Russia the treaty of
Tilsit, by which the two emperors agreed to support one
another, at least passively, in further schemes of aggression.
England alone was hostile, and England, though absolutely
supreme at sea, was helpless on land, having not only no
allies, but no field of action. Napoleon proceeded to give
her both by his interference in the Spanish peninsula. First
he made the Spanish government co-operate with him in a
wolf-and-lamb quarrel with Portugal, occupied that little
country with French troops, before whom the royal family
fled to Brazil, and cheated Spain out of her share of the
spoils. Then by a series of perfidious intrigues he insinuated
a French army into the heart of Spain, got into his
power the weak old king and his foolish heir, made them
both renounce the Spanish crown, and ordered a few
fugitive courtiers to salute his own brother Joseph as king
of Spain. He knew that Spain had no trustworthy army;
he had military possession of the capital, and took for
granted that Spain would acquiesce. But the Spaniards,
proud of past glories, intensely ignorant, and caring very
little for the capital, where alone a few partisans of the new
king could be found, broke out into insurrection everywhere.
The French forces, which were but small, had to retire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>behind the Ebro, one little army that had penetrated into
Andalusia being actually surrounded and compelled to
surrender. Simultaneously an English army landing in
Portugal defeated the French at Vimiero, and obliged them
to evacuate Portugal under a convention. Napoleon, more
irritated than alarmed, poured vast armies into Spain, with
the utmost ease defeated the Spanish levies that tried to
stop him, and entered Madrid in triumph with his puppet
brother in his train. Sir John Moore, who commanded the
small English army in Portugal, made a brilliant march
into the heart of Spain, threatening to cut Napoleon's
communications with France; but he was far too weak to
do more than trouble the emperor's repose. French forces
of full double his numbers were sent to drive him into the
sea, and succeeded, though Moore, turning to bay when he
reached Corunna and found his ships not ready, inflicted on
them a sharp repulse, of which his own life was the glorious
price. Napoleon fondly dreamed that Spain was conquered,
and returned to France, leaving Joseph as titular king, and
several French armies to complete the work.</p>

<p>Had Spain been left unsupported, a real conquest would
still have been impossible, so long as the endurance of the
people lasted. The Spanish armies, if such they can be
called, were defeated and dispersed in fifty battles. Their
generals on very few occasions showed any judgment or
capacity. But the panic-stricken runaways of to-day enlisted
again none the worse in two or three weeks; the generals
discomfited to-day were ready to try again with a serene
self-confidence that was not quite a step beyond the sublime.
Guerilla bands spread everywhere, sometimes serving in a
so-called regular army, sometimes behaving as brigands. A
despatch could not be sent to France without a large
escort: the duty of convoying supplies was incessant,
harassing and often unsuccessful. French armies could
march where they pleased, but could not permanently
conquer a single square mile. On the other hand the
Spaniards unaided could have achieved no definite success
against the French armies, and the strain on Napoleon's
resources, though real, would not have been ruinous. It
was the English intervention which converted the Spanish
ulcer, as Napoleon himself termed it, into a deadly disease
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>eating into the very vitals of his power. A treaty of alliance
was concluded between England and Spain, signed, as it
happened, on the very day of the battle of Corunna
(January 19, 1809). The English government did not then
know how ignorant, how presumptuous, how untrustworthy,
was the knot of self-chosen incapables who styled themselves
the Spanish Junta. Nevertheless they took the wise
resolution of basing their operations on Portugal and not
on Spain. There was a very old alliance with Portugal,
which had made the smaller power for a century almost a
satellite of the greater one: the Portuguese royal family was
in America, and it was hence comparatively easy to rule in
its name. But though political considerations dictated this
step, it entailed also great military advantages. England
having complete command of the sea, the French had to
derive all supplies, except such food as the country afforded,
from France, which was rendered very difficult by the
guerillas. Spain, as a glance at the map shows, is greatly
cut up by mountain chains: of these the Sierra de Guadarrama,
south of the Douro basin, and the Sierra Morena,
north of Andalusia, are serious barriers, though not impassable.
The country between them is mostly barren,
Andalusia (except parts of the east coast which do not enter
into account) being the only very fertile region. Moreover
the roads were few and bad. Hence it followed that large
armies could not long hold together for want of subsistence,
except in Andalusia; while even there a French army could
not stay, if an enemy in the centre of Spain intercepted its
supplies of ammunition, clothing, reinforcements, coming
from France. Moreover in Portugal the English army,
with an excellent harbour at Lisbon through which to draw
its supplies and reinforcements, was on the flank of Spain.
This was clearly the position most favourable<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> for dealing
effective blows at the French power in Spain, taken as a
whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>On these facts, added to the necessity of sparing his men
to the utmost, for the English government could not supply
large numbers, and by no means realised the importance
of their opportunity, Wellington<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> based his general plan.
He was convinced, as his Correspondence shows, that
sooner or later the nations of Europe would combine to
overthrow Napoleon's domination, and that meanwhile to
keep alive resistance in the Peninsula would be a steady
drain on his resources and would set an example to other
nations. Hence his first object was to hold his ground in
Portugal; his second was to trouble the French hold on
Spain when opportunity offered. Finally he hoped, when
pressure elsewhere compelled Napoleon to weaken his
Spanish armies, to drive them altogether from the Peninsula.
Thus the first, and by far the longest, portion of the war is
defensive, the battles being only fought when a paramount
object is to be gained; the latter portion is offensive.</p>

<p>Wellington landed in Portugal on April 22, 1809. Promptly
marching northwards, he forced the passage of the Douro
at Oporto with a cool audacity difficult to surpass, and
drove Soult into the mountains with the loss of his artillery.
Then returning to Lisbon he planned the defensive works
which were to protect him whenever, as was sure to happen,
the French pressed him with overwhelming strength. The
map shows that Lisbon stands at the end of a broad tongue
of land between the estuary of the Tagus and the sea.
The city itself was not beyond the range of guns on the
opposite shore; but ships could be trusted in case of need
to keep at bay any enemy who might come dangerously
near in this quarter. Across the tongue of land, some
twenty-five miles north of Lisbon, a system of forts was
constructed, taking advantage of the heights of Torres
Vedras, and other inequalities of the ground. Another
line, stronger both in form and armament, was drawn ten
miles nearer Lisbon; thus even behind the inner line there
was ample room for an army.</p>

<p>Having ordered these works, Wellington concerted measures
with the Spanish Junta for an advance into Spain.
The plan agreed on was that Wellington in combination with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>Cuesta, who commanded the largest Spanish army, should
move towards Madrid up the valley of the Tagus, while Venegas,
with another Spanish army, approached Madrid from
the south. He soon found out, by bitter experience, what the
Spaniards were worth. The supplies promised to his army
were never forthcoming, though the commissaries unblushingly
asserted afterwards that the English had had double
rations all the time. Cuesta was alternately foolhardy and
timid, his men ready to yield to unmeaning panic; Venegas
was incredibly dilatory: no trustworthy information could be
obtained as to the French armies in the north. Marshal
Victor, who faced the allied armies, retired at first to a point
where he could prevent Venegas from joining Cuesta: then
when he found that the English had halted (Wellington had
positively refused to advance any further without supplies),
and that Cuesta alone was following him, he turned to fight.
The Spanish advanced guard broke and fled, and the whole
army was soon in such a state of confusion and terror that
Victor might have dispersed it, had not the nearest English
division (Sherbrooke's) interposed. Wellington in vain
urged Cuesta to retreat a few miles to the position at
Talavera which he had already selected: the old man took
a mulish delight in rejecting advice. When at dawn next
morning the French approached, and Sherbrooke began to
retire, Cuesta yielded to necessity, but solaced his insane
pride by saying to his staff that he had first made the
Englishman go down on his knees. He yielded however
so completely as to take up the position Wellington assigned
to him, though during the retreat a large part of
Cuesta's army fled in wild panic on the near approach of
some French horse.</p>

<p>The valley of the Tagus being but narrow, the allied
armies were able to cover the whole space between the
river and the northern hills. The Spanish troops had
their right resting on the Tagus, close to the little town
of Talavera, and their front was covered by buildings,
ditches, and other obstacles, so that it could hardly be
assailed. The left of the Spaniards and right of the
English was protected by a large redoubt; from this the
English divisions stretched across the plain, their left on a
little hill, separated by a deep and narrow bit of valley from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>the boundary hills. Victor, coming up before evening, saw
that the hill on the English left was but slightly occupied
(by some mistake General Hill had not taken up his
position), and tried to seize it by a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de main</i>. The
attack might have succeeded, had not some of the French
troops gone astray in the failing light and intricate ground;
it was not without some hard fighting that it was repulsed.
Another attempt was made early the next morning (July 28)
with an even worse result: for Wellington was led by it to
strengthen his left, and render any turning movement much
more unpromising than before. King Joseph, who was on
the field in person, was advised by his military tutor,
Marshal Jourdan, to retreat. It was known to the French,
though not as yet to Wellington, that Soult's army from
near Salamanca would come into the valley of the Tagus
behind the allies in a very few days, and the English must
either decamp promptly, or be cut off from Portugal.
Thus the game would be won without risk, whereas a third
attack on Wellington might well end like the others.
Victor however was urgent for a renewal of the battle,
and Joseph foolishly assented. During this interval the
Spaniards were in great confusion, and one of the few
generals who were worth anything sent word to Wellington
that Cuesta was betraying him. The message was delivered
to the commander of an English brigade who conveyed it
to Wellington. "The latter, seated on the summit of the
hill which had been so gallantly contested, was intently
watching the movements of the advancing enemy; he
listened to this somewhat startling message without so
much as turning his head, and then drily answering: 'Very
well, you may return to your brigade,' continued his survey
of the French.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>" Cuesta did not in fact signify, though it
required coolness as well as ability to discern it at such
a moment. The renewed French attack was directed as
before against the British half of the position, a single
brigade of cavalry being placed to watch the Spaniards.
About two o'clock the French advanced against the whole
line, the great object being as before to break or turn the
left. Victor had sufficient advantage of numbers over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>English alone to engage them on about equal terms on the
right, and send a division to turn the left, while attacking
with some superiority of force the centre and left. The
hill on the left was as before the key of the position, but
Victor, had his movements succeeded, would have compelled
its abandonment by easier means than mere direct
attack. The French left came on with great impetuosity,
but Campbell's division advancing in line to meet the
columns drove them back with severe loss, and then resumed
its position, while the artillery played on the French,
and prevented their renewing the attack. In the centre
things followed at first much the same course: but there
the English guards in repulsing the assault followed up
their enemies too far, and were driven back, the French being
able to bring overwhelming artillery fire to bear on them;
the German legion which formed the rest of Sherbrooke's
division was also shaken. The centre seemed broken;
but Wellington had drawn down the 48th from the hill on
the left. With his usual tactical insight he had seen that
the hill would be of no use if he were beaten in the centre;
the left must for the moment take care of itself. As on
the right, the line showed its superiority over column: after
wheeling back to let the retiring crowds pass, the 48th
resumed its advance, and pushing the victorious French
back, gave time and space for the guards and the Germans
to rally, which they quickly did.</p>

<p>Before this, there had occurred on the left one of those
heroic feats which military theorists truly say are contrary to
all rules of tactics, but which experience shows to be high
above rules. On seeing the French division making its way
through the narrow valley to his left, Wellington ordered
Anson's cavalry brigade to charge them. As they neared the
French, who formed squares, they suddenly came on a slight
but steep-sided ravine. The veteran colonel of the German
hussars stopped short, as he had a perfect right to do, exclaiming,
"I will not kill my young men;" but the 23rd light
dragoons plunged headlong into the ravine, scrambled up
the opposite bank, naturally in great confusion, rallied,
dashed between the French squares, and fell furiously on
a cavalry regiment in rear. More enemies coming up
when they were overmatched already, the 23rd was utterly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>broken, and only half their number escaped to the protection
of their own lines. The advance of the French was
however stopped: after this experience they had no mind
to press forward into the plain where masses of fresh
cavalry stood in reserve; and the repulse of the centre
taking place just afterwards, the whole French army returned,
foiled but by no means routed, to their original
position. Had the Spaniards been trustworthy, Wellington
might even yet have won a great victory; but then had
they been so, there would have been no battle of Talavera
at all. The Spanish troops engaged amounted to three or
four regiments and a few guns. The rest did no more for
Wellington than what a natural obstacle might have done,
in preventing his right flank being turned. In nominal
force the advantage was with the allies, who gained also
by standing on the defensive, the numbers being under
50,000 French, against at least 54,000, though the French
had great superiority in cavalry; but then 34,000 of these
were Spanish. The losses on both sides were severe,
Wellington losing over 6000 killed and wounded, the
French a thousand more.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The day after the battle, when the French were retreating
and Wellington was not attempting to pursue them, he
was joined by Craufurd's brigade, consisting of the 43rd,
52nd, and 95th. These troops, halting on their way to join
the army, were met by crowds of the Spanish fugitives of
the 27th, telling the wildest tales of disaster. Craufurd was
then fully four ordinary days' march from Talavera, but he
resolved not to halt again, and "in 26 hours they crossed
the field of battle in a close and compact body, having in
the time passed over 62 English miles, and in the hottest
season of the year, each man carrying from 50 to 60 pounds
weight upon his shoulders."</p>

<p>Wellington had not yet fully learned what the Spaniards
were good for. Not content with putting every obstacle in
the way of the English obtaining provisions in Talavera,
and accommodation for the wounded, of which Cuesta had
hardly any himself, the Spanish general obstinately refused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>till too late to take any steps to observe and delay Soult's
approach, of which the allies had now somewhat vague
information. Wellington, who could on no account allow
his retreat on Lisbon to be cut off, was obliged to move
himself towards Soult, and left his wounded in care of
Cuesta, whose line of retreat being to the south was not
endangered, and who solemnly promised to provide transport
for all who could be moved. Wellington soon found
that Soult's force had been much underrated, and that he
must retire towards Portugal, whereupon Cuesta abandoned
the English wounded, all of whom, except those who died
of neglect and starvation, fell into the hands of the French.
It is no wonder that after his experience of Cuesta, Wellington
steadily refused to combine operations with any Spanish
general.</p>

<p>The campaign of Talavera may in some sense be called
a failure; it was too soon to attempt to shake the French
hold on Spain, though Wellington may be excused for
the mistake. The magnificent defence of Saragossa had
created a great sensation; there was no doubt Spaniards
could fight. No one could have imagined the ignorance
and the irrational pride of their commanders, or the
amazing assurance with which government and generals alike
gave elaborate undertakings which they never meant to
fulfil. At the same time the slaughter of Talavera was not
wasted: the victory gave the English cabinet, and still
more the nation, confidence alike in their general and in his
troops. Talavera was the first distinct defeat sustained by
a French army of any size since Napoleon had appeared
on the scene.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Wellington had two long years of severe
struggle before the tide began to flow in his favour, contending
at once with the far superior strength of the French and
with half-heartedness at home; it may be doubted whether,
without Talavera to his credit, he would have successfully
overcome these difficulties.</p>

<p>In 1810 Napoleon gave the chief command to Massena,
the ablest of his marshals with one possible exception, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>only one who had gained distinction at the head of an
independent army. Massena's instructions were, in one of
Napoleon's pet phrases, to drive the English into the sea,
and the emperor, who could estimate no forces that could
not be expressed in battalions, had every reason to expect
that he would achieve his task. Wellington's scheme of
defence was based on the geographical conditions. Three
important rivers flow out of Spain across Portugal into the
Atlantic. Where the Guadiana crosses the frontier stands
the great fortress of Badajos on the Spanish side, faced by
Elvas on the Portuguese. As both were at this time in the
hands of the allies (Elvas indeed remained so throughout)
they formed a serious obstacle to an attack on Portugal
from this direction. Moreover it was obviously absurd for
Massena to base his attack on the south, lengthening his
communications by hundreds of miles: all that was possible
was a subsidiary attack from the French army in Andalusia,
already fully occupied with the hopeless siege of Cadiz.
The Tagus valley is narrow, and barren of supplies, and
almost as circuitous a route from France as the Guadiana.
North of the Tagus, the Sierra de Estrella, which is a sort
of continuation of the Sierra de Guadarrama, though at an
angle to it, lies behind the frontier between Spain and
Portugal. The roads across it into the Tagus basin were
few and bad, and Wellington took care to render them
worse. Thus the only route that needed serious defence
was the northern one by the broad valley of the Douro, the
natural and obvious course for an invader based on France,
the easiest for an army, though not the shortest, between
Lisbon and Madrid. Here also two fortresses faced each
other across the frontier, Ciudad Rodrigo in Spain on the
Agueda, Almeida in Portugal on the Coa, both rivers
tributaries to the Douro. Strong as Massena was, he could
not spare troops effectually to blockade these, and yet have
sufficient superiority to drive Wellington before him. As a
necessary preliminary therefore the two fortresses must be
taken. Wellington took up his position near the frontier,
so as to harass<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Massena wherever it was possible without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>fighting a battle, and waited. Ciudad Rodrigo, weakly
garrisoned by Spaniards, cost Massena forty days; the
commandant, who did his best manfully, was naturally loud
in his appeals for help, but Wellington turned a deaf ear.
It would have been quixotic to fight a great battle against
heavy odds to save a small garrison; as well might a chess-player
sacrifice his queen to save a pawn. The turn of
Almeida followed, though in consequence of an accidental
explosion the siege did not last long. The way was now
open for Massena to invade Portugal, though, thanks to
Ciudad Rodrigo and to Craufurd, September had been
reached. He resolved, as Wellington had hoped, to follow
the course of the Mondego.</p>

<p>Sixteen months had now elapsed since Wellington assumed
the command. During that time the lines of Torres
Vedras had been completed, though no outsiders seem to
have understood them, and the Portugese troops, largely
officered by Englishmen, had been gradually organised and
disciplined. Moreover Wellington had obtained from the
Portuguese government authority to order the withdrawal
of the inhabitants, and the destruction of mills, barns,
everything that could aid the invader. This policy, though
not effectually carried out, caused serious difficulty to
Massena, and striking the imagination of the Czar of Russia,
furnished the model for the defence of that country against
Napoleon in 1812. Before the superior force of the
French, Wellington had no choice but to retreat, as he had
always intended to do: but the Portuguese government, a
prey at this time to absurd faction, raised a violent clamour,
obstructed his measures for clearing the country, and
inspired a general panic among the inhabitants of Lisbon,
including even the English civilians. Wellington found it
necessary to risk a battle, against his military judgment, in
order to prove how irrational was the panic dread of the
French, in order also to gain a little more time for clearing
the country in front of the lines of Torres Vedras. Fortunately
Massena, who was very badly informed, played
into his hands: instead of making his way across towards
the coast, into the great road from Oporto to Lisbon, he
took the direct but very bad road down the Mondego,
which, besides other disadvantages, gave his opponent the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>chance of turning to bay in a most formidable position.
Not only so, he did not press his advance, and so allowed
time for Wellington to draw to him the English divisions
which had been left to guard the Tagus until it was certain
that the French were not coming that way.</p>

<p>The position of Busaco, somewhat too large even for the
whole army, would not have been tenable without these troops.
It is a mountain ridge, one end abutting on the Mondego,
the other joining high, more difficult mountains, with a road
running along its crest, and its northern face falling very
steeply into a deep ravine, whence an equally steep ascent
led up to lower uneven ground over which the French line
of approach lay. Moreover projecting masses afforded
positions for artillery to sweep a great part of the face.
Nothing but infantry could obviously be used to assail such
a position. Marshal Ney, who was with the French
advanced guard, perceived that it was only partially occupied,
and would have attacked at once; but Massena was
ten miles in rear, and refused his consent. Two days later
all Wellington's divisions had joined him; the peculiarities
of the ground had been made the most of, and it was too
late. On September 27 the French came on in two great
columns with their usual dash and rapidity. The left
column, directed a little to the right of the English centre,
for a time succeeded in breaking a gap in the English line,
till Hill's division, hastening along the ridge from the right
(it was in this quarter that the excessive length of the
position had caused part to be unoccupied), drove them
down again. The other attack, much further towards the
English left, had a still more disastrous fate. Craufurd,
taking advantage of a hollow on the face of the slope, had
drawn up two regiments in line, out of sight of the ascending
French, which, as the head of the enemy's column
reached the edge of the hollow, suddenly advanced and
hurled them back with terrible slaughter. A similar fate
befell the smaller and less serious efforts made by the
assailants: the attack was doomed to certain failure, if only
the defending army stood steady. How disastrous was the
repulse may be estimated from the fact that while Wellington
lost about 1300 men, Massena lost considerably over three
times that number. One advantage Wellington gained from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>the battle: his Portuguese troops had been given their fair
share of the fighting, and learned by the victory that they
need not regard the French as their superiors.</p>

<p>Busaco is an instructive battle in more ways than one.
From Wellington's side it is an instance of a political battle,
as Napier calls it, of political motives, not military ones,
determining a general's action. On Massena's side it
illustrates the important lesson that faulty information may
easily be ruinous. Not only had he taken the wrong route,
believing it to be the best; he also engaged under the
impression that the only other alternative was a retreat
nearly to Almeida, whereas all the time there was a road
over the mountains to his right, which would have enabled
him to turn Busaco. On the night of the battle he found
this out, and masking the movement next day with a
skirmishing attack on the position, he threw his whole
army into this narrow cross-road. Had the English general
been less hampered by the political conditions, he might
well have made Massena rue his audacity in trying so
proverbially dangerous a thing as a flank march in presence
of the enemy. As it was he felt bound simply to resume
his retreat, of which, once in the open country, there could
be no cessation, until the lines of Torres Vedras were
reached. Massena had never even heard of the lines till a
short time before he came in sight of them; it is strange that
so little was known about them, seeing that no such elaborate
works had been constructed in Europe since the days when
the Romans, in the decline of the empire, built their great
walls in Northumberland and elsewhere to keep out the
barbarians. Massena reconnoitred them from end to end,
in the hope of finding a weak spot; but the more he looked
at them, the more hopeless the prospect of an assault
appeared, for every day in fact added to their strength.
After a month he withdrew to Santarem, high up the Tagus,
where subsistence was procurable, and there remained all
the winter. Wellington was far too severely hampered by
politics to attack him. The Portuguese nation was as a
whole sound in its patriotism, and the troops only wanted to
be taught; but the politicians were selfish, narrow-minded
and factious to an incredible extent, and Wellington found
it harder to master the politicians than to stop Massena.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>Moreover the English government was all this time in a state
of perplexity and weakness,<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and gave the army in Portugal
nothing which could on any pretence be withheld.</p>

<p>Thus March arrived before reinforcements reached Wellington;
and then Massena, whose army was greatly diminished
through sickness, began his retreat, despairing of reinforcements
reaching him in time, or of any effective diversion
being caused by the French army of Andalusia. Massena's
retreat was conducted with great skill, and it was not till he
was nearing Almeida that the pursuing army was able to
gain any great advantage over him. Wellington was in
truth at the beginning anxious to relieve Badajos, which
Soult was besieging with an army from Andalusia, and
which was at first gallantly defended by the Spanish
garrison. But the commandant having been killed, his
successor, traitor or coward, instantly surrendered. The
disaster having happened, Wellington followed up Massena
more vigorously, and when he had pushed him far enough,
detached Beresford with a considerable English force to
combine with the Spaniards, and attempt to recover Badajos.
He himself pressed Massena back to Ciudad Rodrigo, and
blockaded Almeida, accepting battle rather than abandon
the prey which had nearly fallen into his hands. The
battle of Fuentes d'Onoro, fought on May 5, 1811, was not
particularly creditable to either of the rival generals.
Tactically it was a drawn battle, strategically it was a distinct
victory for Wellington; for Massena, probably piqued at
hearing of his supercession by Marmont, retired after the
action, leaving Almeida to its fate. The commandant however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
was equal to the occasion; blowing up the works as
completely as he could, he led the garrison out, and with a
mixture of skill and good fortune made his way in safety
through the besieging lines. Almeida was of no immediate
use, but it remained in Wellington's hands, something at
least of a barrier against a fresh invasion of Portugal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Beresford had commenced on the very day of
the battle of Fuentes d'Onoro a so-called siege of Badajos.
He had no proper siege train, and must have failed in any
case: but within a week Soult was approaching, and the
attempt had to be abandoned. Beresford very unwisely
yielded to the eagerness of his own troops and the wish of
the Spanish generals, and agreed to accept battle&mdash;very unwisely,
for nothing could be gained, and much might be
lost. Even victory would be contrary to Wellington's
principle of not expending a British soldier unless for an
adequate end. It is true that he had 30,000 infantry, while
Soult had only 19,000; but a very large majority of these
were Spanish troops, nearly starved and miserably led: on
the other hand Soult was superior in guns, and had double
the number of cavalry. Moreover Beresford mismanaged
his position. He occupied a line of high ground with the
fordable stream of the Albuera in front of it. As the road
which formed his line of retreat led away in rear of his left
centre, he perhaps naturally placed his English and Portuguese
on the left, leaving the Spanish general Blake, over
whom he had no authority, to occupy the centre and right,
which was posted on the famous hill for which the battle of
Albuera will ever be remembered. So far he had perhaps
done wisely, but he neglected to occupy a detached hill on
the other side of the stream opposite his right; and behind
this hill Soult was able to mass his troops unobserved. The
battle (May 16, 1811) began as Beresford expected, with an
attack on the bridge and village of Albuera in front of his
left; but this was only a feint. Simultaneously more than
half the French army moved out from under cover of the
hill that Beresford had ignored, and were soon in line across
his right flank. Blake refused to believe the evidence of his
senses until too late; the Spaniards were only beginning to
form a new front to the right when the French were upon them.
Naturally they were thrown into confusion. Stewart coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>up with a British division to their support was in so great a
hurry that he did not form line until he reached the summit
level of the hill. A mass of French cavalry, their approach
unseen in the obscurity of a heavy storm, charged the leading
brigade as it was forming, and nearly destroyed it.
Fortunately the same darkness concealed this blow from
Soult, and the rest of the division had time to reach the hill
and renew the fight; part of the Spanish troops also were
brought into action. Both sides fought desperately, but the
line formation of the English gave them some little advantage
over the close columns of the French. Beresford for a
moment wavered, but recovered himself, and acquiesced in
the order already given in his name, to bring up practically
the last reserves to sustain the conflict on the hill. The
chief stress fell on the fusileer brigade, consisting of the 7th
and 23rd regiments under General Myers, and led into
action by General Cole commanding the division, which
mounted the hill just in the nick of time.</p>

<p>"At this time six guns were in the enemy's possession,
the whole of Werl√©'s reserves were coming forward to reinforce
the front column of the French, the remnant of
Houghton's brigade could no longer maintain its ground,
the field was heaped with carcases, the lancers were riding
furiously about the captured artillery on the upper parts of
the hill, and behind all, Hamilton's Portuguese and Alten's
Germans, now withdrawing from the bridge, seemed to be
in full retreat. Soon however Cole's fusileers, flanked by a
battalion of the Lusitanian legion under Colonel Hawkshawe,
mounted the hill, drove off the lancers, recovered
five of the captured guns and one colour, and appeared on
the right of Houghton's brigade precisely as Abercrombie
passed it on the left.</p>

<p>"Such a gallant line, issuing from the midst of the smoke
and rapidly separating itself from the confused and broken
multitude, startled the enemy's heavy masses, which were
increasing and pressing onwards as to an assured victory:
they wavered, hesitated, and then vomiting forth a storm of
fire, hastily endeavoured to enlarge their front, while a
fearful discharge of grape from all their artillery whistled
through the British ranks. Myers was killed, Cole, the three
colonels, Ellis, Blakeney, and Hawkshawe, fell wounded, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>the fusileer battalions, struck by the iron tempest, reeled
and staggered like sinking ships. But suddenly and sternly
recovering they closed on their terrible enemies: and then
was seen with what a strength and majesty the British
soldier fights. In vain did Soult with voice and gesture
animate his Frenchmen; in vain did the hardiest veterans
break from the crowded columns and sacrifice their lives to
gain time for the mass to open out on such a fair field; in
vain did the mass itself bear up, and fiercely striving, fire
indiscriminately upon friends and foes, while the horsemen
hovering on the flank threatened to charge the advancing
line. Nothing could stop that astonishing infantry. No
sudden burst of undisciplined valour, no nervous enthusiasm
weakened the stability of their order, their flashing eyes
were bent on the dark columns in their front, their measured
tread shook the ground, their dreadful volleys swept away
the head of every formation, their deafening shouts overpowered
the dissonant cries that broke from all parts of the
tumultuous crowd, as slowly and with a horrid carnage it
was pushed by the incessant vigour of the attack to the
farthest edge of the height. There the French reserves
mixed with the struggling multitude and endeavoured to
sustain the fight, but the effort only increased the irremediable
confusion, the mighty mass gave way and like a
loosened cliff went headlong down the steep: the rain
flowed after in streams discoloured with blood, and eighteen
hundred unwounded men, the remnant of six thousand
unconquerable British soldiers, stood triumphant on the
fatal hill."</p>

<p>Soult was defeated: he had lost a third of his army, and
did not see his way to renew the conflict, though his still
formidable cavalry and artillery would have enabled him to
do so with good prospects. Beresford deserves credit for
holding his ground boldly, though he was well aware that
his crippled army was incapable of fighting again: to retreat
was to render inevitable the destruction which a confident
attitude might and did avert.</p>

<p>Wellington, relieved from any further anxiety in the north,
came to Beresford's support. During the rest of the year
he continued his system of remaining practically on the
defensive, while giving the French as much annoyance as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>possible. He attempted a fresh siege of Badajos, which
had the effect of bringing Marmont down from the Douro
basin, and Soult back from Andalusia. Then retiring to a
position to cover Elvas he awaited attack, which the French
marshals, hampered by various difficulties, declined to make.
Later in the year he blockaded Ciudad Rodrigo, compelling
the French armies to concentrate for its support, and again
retiring before superior force. His political difficulties,
strictly so called, were as great as ever, perhaps greater:
for the Portuguese authorities took advantage of his successes
to assume that the war was over and that the British
army might be got rid of, and the home government supported
him but feebly. But his army was more and more
inured to war, and his Portuguese well worthy to stand in
line with the English. Moreover Napoleon was already
beginning to withdraw troops from Spain for the huge army
he was organising against Russia. It was practically certain,
when 1811 closed, that 1812 would see Napoleon engaged
in a gigantic contest with Russia. The day for which
Wellington had been waiting patiently was beginning to
dawn.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>THE PENINSULA<br />

PART II.&mdash;OFFENSIVE</small></h2>


<p>During the year 1811 the French arms made considerable
progress on the east side of Spain: this did not
however give them any real additional advantage as against
Wellington. They had more fortresses to garrison, more
territory to occupy, and the Spanish armies went on causing
much the same trouble to them as before. Moreover
Napoleon's system of giving the various generals independent
spheres of action, with no common control except
his own, worked in Wellington's favour. If he made a
threatening movement against Marmont, who commanded
what was called the army of Portugal, occupying the basin
of the upper Douro, or against Soult in Andalusia, neither
marshal could order the other to assist him by a diversion.
There was an obvious difference between combined action
ordered by a chief who controlled the whole, and co-operation
arranged between equals who had each his own
separate ends in view. Napoleon should either have come
to Spain in person&mdash;he was too far off in point of time to
direct from Paris&mdash;or have given one marshal<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> command
throughout the country. When towards the end of 1811
Wellington judged that the time was come for operations
no longer merely defensive in purpose, he formed his plans
to take advantage of this want of union among his enemies.</p>

<p>It has been pointed out that the ways into Spain from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>Portugal are practically three: but the central one by the
valley of the Tagus being ill suited for the movements of
armies, there are but two really advantageous. That by
the basin of the Douro is guarded at the frontier by two
fortresses, Almeida and Ciudad Rodrigo; that by the
Guadiana is guarded by Elvas and Badajos. Without
possession of the pair of fortresses commanding one route
or the other, invasion is scarcely feasible: with both pairs
in his hands Wellington could choose, and he already held
both Almeida and Elvas. Accordingly he resolved during
the winter season, when the French would have serious
difficulty in moving, to besiege first one and then the other
of the Spanish border fortresses. He began with Ciudad
Rodrigo, partly because it was the easier task to prepare
for, as he had a battering-train in Almeida of which the
French knew nothing (the guns were supposed to have been
brought there to arm the fortress), partly because he then
purposed to move against Soult if he succeeded in capturing
Badajos. The preparations for the siege were very quietly
made in Almeida, and on January 8, 1812, the first British
troops appeared before Ciudad Rodrigo. That very
evening a detached fort to the north of the town was suddenly
stormed, which enabled the trenches to be begun
much nearer to the walls than could otherwise have been
done. Wellington had calculated that he should require
twenty-four days, but the uncertainties were great, for
besides the prospect of Marmont coming to its relief, there
was always the risk that heavy rain might raise the river
Agueda in flood prematurely, which would have stopped
the siege by intercepting communication across it. On the
19th the walls were sufficiently breached to make storming
them possible, though according to the ordinary rules of
siege warfare much remained to be done before an assault
was made. Wellington however knew as well how and
when to make a sacrifice in order to attain an adequate
object, as how to spare his men: he issued orders for the
assault to take place that night, ending with the emphatic
words: "Ciudad Rodrigo must be stormed this evening."
There were two breaches near together on the north face of
the fortress, both of which were directly assailed, besides
minor attacks on other points. The fighting at the main
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>breach was desperate, for the French were well prepared:
possibly the attack there might not have succeeded, but the
conflict was ended by the success of the light division at
the smaller breach.</p>

<p>"The bottom of the ditch was dark and intricate, and the
forlorn hope took too much to their left; but the storming
party went straight to the breach, which was so contracted
that a gun placed lengthwise across the top nearly blocked
up the opening. Here the forlorn hope rejoined the
stormers, but when two-thirds of the ascent were gained,
the leading men, crushed together by the narrowness of the
place, staggered under the weight of the enemy's fire; and
such is the instinct of self-defence, that although no man
had been allowed to load, every musket in the crowd was
snapped. The commander, Major Napier, was at this
moment stricken to the earth by a grape-shot which shattered
his arm, but he called on his men to trust to their bayonets,
and all the officers simultaneously sprang to the front, when
the charge was renewed with a furious shout, and the
entrance was gained. The supporting regiments, coming
up in sections abreast, then reached the rampart, the 52nd
wheeled to the left, the 43rd to the right, and the place
was won."</p>

<p>The loss of life was great, the English having nearly as
many killed and wounded as the whole garrison: General
Craufurd, the brilliant commander of the light division, was
killed. The officer who led the forlorn hope at the lesser
breach was the man to whom the governor of Ciudad
Rodrigo surrendered, an incident probably unique in the
annals of siege warfare. The advantage gained, which was
attainable in no other way, was well worth the cost. It was
henceforth impossible for Marmont seriously to invade the
north-east of Portugal: and the capture in Ciudad Rodrigo
of Marmont's battering-train made it certain that he would
not even try.</p>

<p>Wellington's calculations were nicely adapted to the
season of the year, as well as to the other conditions. He
felt sure that in the rains of February and March, with all
the rivers in flood, Marmont could not practically move at
all, and that therefore he might be watched by a very small
force, while he himself went south to continue the scheme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>he had formed. Elvas served, as Almeida had done, for a
convenient place to make siege preparations within a short
distance of Badajos, and on March 16 the famous siege
was begun, ten days at least later than Wellington had
intended, through the default of the Portuguese in providing
transport. This was a much more serious task than the
capture of Ciudad Rodrigo, the garrison being three times
as large, the defences stronger, and the governor, Phillipon,
a man of great energy and fertility of resource. Two of
Soult's divisions were near at hand; but Wellington, having
decided that he might practically ignore Marmont, had
plenty of men to spare for covering the siege, at least until
Soult should approach with his whole army. He had also
arranged, so far as it was possible to arrange anything with
the Spanish armies, that one of them should be in a position
to march on Seville if Soult denuded Andalusia too completely
of troops.</p>

<p>Badajos is situated on the south bank of the Guadiana,
with a strong fort on the north bank. The castle was at
the north-east corner of the town, close to the river: along
the east face a rivulet flowing into the Guadiana had been
artificially extended into a complete defence for nearly half
the length. A small outwork covered the northern end of
this piece of water, and outside its southern end, on an
isolated hill, stood a work called the Picurina. The plan
was to breach, at the south-eastern corner of the town, the
two great bastions known as the Trinidad and the <abbr title="Santa">Sta.</abbr>
Maria, and the curtain uniting them. In order that this
might be done effectually, the Picurina must first be taken,
and after the siege works had made sufficient progress, on
the night of March 25, this work was stormed, and batteries
constructed on its ruins. As the siege progressed, Soult
drew near, and arrangements were actually made for leaving
two divisions to hold the trenches, and marching with the
rest of the army to give him battle. On April 6 however
the breaches were reported practicable, Soult being still
some way off; Badajos could therefore be assaulted with
adequate force.</p>

<p>Three separate attacks were arranged, besides minor ones
merely to distract attention, all to begin at ten p.m. The
third division, Picton's, was to cross the rivulet on the east
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>side and scale the castle walls; the fifth was to attack the
west face of the town; to the fourth and light divisions was
assigned the frightful task of storming the breaches. A fireball
thrown by the French however disclosed to them the
third division ready formed and awaiting the signal: the
assault was consequently begun half-an-hour sooner on the
east and south-east, and the perfect concert with the other
distant attacks was lost. After one failure, the third division
succeeded in scaling the castle and driving the French out
of it, but were unable for some time to advance any further.
The assault on the breaches was one of the most terrible
scenes on record. Nothing could exceed the determination
of the stormers, but the French had made preparations for
defence which were simply insuperable.</p>

<p>"Now a multitude bounded up the great breach as if
driven by a whirlwind, but across the top glittered a range
of sword-blades, sharp-pointed, keen-edged on both sides,
and firmly fixed in ponderous beams, which were chained
together and set deep in the ruins; and for ten feet in front,
the ascent was covered with loose planks, studded with
sharp iron points, on which the feet of the foremost being
set the planks moved, and the unhappy soldiers, falling
forward on the spikes, rolled down upon the ranks behind.
Then the Frenchmen, shouting at the success of their
stratagem, and leaping forward, plied their shot with terrible
rapidity, for every man had several muskets; and each
musket in addition to its ordinary charge contained a small
cylinder of wood stuck full of leaden slugs which scattered
like hail when they were discharged.</p>

<p>"Again the assailants rushed up the breaches, and again
the sword-blades, immovable and impassable, stopped their
charge, and the hissing shells and thundering powder-barrels
exploded unceasingly. Hundreds of men had fallen, and
hundreds more were dropping, but still the heroic officers
called aloud for new trials, and sometimes followed by many,
sometimes by a few, ascended the ruins; and so furious
were the men themselves, that in one of these charges, the
rear strove to push the foremost on to the sword-blades,
willing even to make a bridge of their writhing bodies, but
the others frustrated the attempt by dropping down; and
men fell so fast from the shot, that it was hard to know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>who went down voluntarily, who were stricken, and many
stooped unhurt that never rose again. Vain also would it
have been to break through the sword-blades, for the trench
and parapet behind the breach were finished, and the assailants,
crowded into even a narrower space than the ditch
was, would still have been separated from their enemies, and
the slaughter would have continued.</p>

<p>"Two hours spent in these vain efforts convinced the
soldiers that the breach of the Trinidad was impregnable;
and as the opening in the curtain, although less strong, was
retired, and the approach to it impeded by deep holes, and
cuts made in the ditch, the troops did not much notice it
after the partial failure of one attack which had been made
early. Gathering in dark groups and leaning on their
muskets, they looked up with sullen desperation at the
Trinidad, while the enemy stepping out on the ramparts,
and aiming their shots by the light of the fire-balls which
they threw over, asked, as their victims fell, '<em>Why they did
not come into Badajos?</em>'"</p>

<p>Meanwhile the attack on the west face of the town had
succeeded, after one or two attempts, and soldiers of the
fifth division were making their way into the empty streets.
Wellington, ignorant of this, and perceiving no movement
from the castle, the capture of which had been reported to
him, ordered the assailants of the breaches to withdraw and
re-form for a fresh attack. This however was not necessary:
the French, taken in flank both from the castle and from
the west, abandoned the defence. The relics of the garrison
which had withdrawn to the outlying fort north of the
Guadiana surrendered next morning. Over the frightful
expenditure of life in this storm, and over the horrors of the
sack of Badajos, it is better to draw a veil. Wellington's
Peninsular veterans were capable of any deeds of desperate
courage, or of steady endurance, but they were also capable
of great atrocities on the rare occasions when their officers
lost control over them.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, to whom Ciudad Rodrigo had been
handed over, had so grossly neglected the duty of repairing
the fortifications, and the Portuguese government was so
dilatory, to use no stronger word, in supplying all four
fortresses, that Wellington's plan for invading Andalusia, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a><br /><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>fight Soult there, was necessarily abandoned. The defensive
side of his duty was obviously the essential one. Still he
had it now in his power to choose his own route and his
own time for entrance into Spain: and he utilised the
interval to render the communications of the French circuitous
and difficult. Soult's bridge train having been captured
in Badajos, a stroke of good fortune which matched the
capture of Marmont's siege train in Ciudad Rodrigo, they
could only cross the Tagus at permanent bridges. The
lowest bridge on the Tagus, a boat bridge protected by three
small forts, was at Almaraz; and General Hill by a brilliant
dash seized the forts and destroyed the bridge. Almost
simultaneously the bridge over the Tagus at Alcantara, down
in Portugal, was skilfully repaired. The combined result of
the two operations was to make the communication between
Hill, who was left to watch the Guadiana, and Wellington
when he moved to the Douro region, a fortnight shorter than
the distance between Marmont and Soult's northernmost
division.</p>

</div>

<p>On June 13, the spring rains being over, Wellington,
having concentrated his immediate army near Ciudad Rodrigo,
marched on Salamanca. His motives for deciding to
operate against Marmont rather than in Andalusia seem to
have been various, some embracing the whole area of the
Peninsula, one at least the practical consideration that his
supplies, brought by water up the Douro, could more quickly
and easily be conveyed to the army. He had no intention
of running serious risks, or of fighting a great battle unless he
could do so under favourable conditions. If successful, he
could greatly shake the French hold on Spain: if he found
Marmont too strong, his retreat into Portugal was insured by
possession of the fortresses. Marmont retired at once, leaving
garrisons in the forts round Salamanca. These forts offered
unexpectedly long resistance, and Wellington, encamped on
the high ground north-east of the city, did not think it
prudent to risk a battle until they were in his hands, though
Marmont's somewhat rash man&oelig;uvres, undertaken in the
hope of saving them, gave him more than one opportunity.
On the 27th the forts fell, and Marmont, having no longer
any motive for lingering near Salamanca, and expecting
reinforcements from the north, promptly retreated behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>the Douro. Wellington followed, but could not pass the
river, of which the enemy held or had destroyed the bridges,
except by deep and dangerous fords. He could only wait
for his antagonist to make the next move, which soon came.
On receiving his reinforcements, Marmont re-crossed the
Douro, and a series of complicated movements ensued, in
which Marmont out-man&oelig;uvred Wellington, compelling him
to retire on Salamanca again, and seizing passages over the
river Tormes above the city. That river, after flowing northwards
for some distance, makes a great bend to the westward
from a point about east of Salamanca, and then after
passing the town, which is on its right bank, flows away
north-westwards into the Douro. It was in the space enclosed
by this curve of the Tormes, south-east from Salamanca,
that the great battle was fought. Marmont's purpose
in crossing the river into this space was to threaten the
Ciudad Rodrigo road, and so compel Wellington to retreat
or lose his one line of communication. Wellington naturally
also crossed the Tormes by the fords near Salamanca:
being aware that further reinforcements, especially of cavalry,
in which Marmont was relatively deficient, would arrive in
a day or so, he had made up his mind to retreat at night
unless something unexpected should happen. And the unexpected
did happen: Marmont, who had hitherto carried
off the honours of the campaign so far as man&oelig;uvring went,
for there had been no important fighting, suddenly committed
a gross tactical blunder.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of July 22, Wellington's army
occupied a position three or four miles from Salamanca,
the left resting on the ford of Santa Marta above the town,
with Pakenham's division beyond the river, and the right
extending nearly to two small rugged hills, called the
Arapiles. Marmont, whose object was to turn the English
right, and so cut them off from the Ciudad Rodrigo road,
and compel them to fight with their backs to the Tormes,
made a demonstration towards Wellington's right front,
driving in the cavalry occupying posts in front, while the
mass of the French army marched in a direction to bring
them across the flank of the English line. The possession
of the Arapiles would have enabled him to form line across
Wellington's flank unopposed, if not undiscovered: accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
he sent forward a detachment to seize them. A
staff officer saw this movement beginning, and informed
Wellington, who hitherto had neglected the little hills,
apparently not expecting Marmont's movement. Just in
time a Portuguese regiment occupied the northernmost of
the two Arapiles, but the French could not be prevented
from seizing the other. Marmont had thus secured part
of the advantage he aimed at, on the other hand Wellington
was now fully aware of his adversary's purpose. Accordingly
he formed his army on a new front facing southwards:
what had been his right became the left resting on the
Arapiles hill, the main body massed on the slopes behind
the hill, while the right occupied the little village of
Arapiles. Pakenham's division, with its attendant brigade
of cavalry, was at the same time brought across the Tormes,
and posted at Aldea Tejada, two or three miles off, where
it covered the Ciudad Rodrigo road, and was completely
out of sight of the French. Wellington had thus gone far
towards neutralising the advantage which he had allowed
Marmont to gain in turning his right: he held a strong
position, difficult to assail, and it was open to him to retreat
under cover of the darkness, though it would have been
more than dangerous to do so in the day-time.</p>

<p>Several hours passed away, for a great part of Marmont's
army had far to march before coming into position. The
marshal at last grew impatient, and in order to draw Wellington
from his position, ordered his left, Thomi√®re's division of
infantry with a quantity of cavalry and guns, to move westwards
so as to threaten the Ciudad Rodrigo road. Marmont
was of course totally ignorant that Pakenham's division was
ready to stop any such movement: but anyhow the mistake
was flagrant, as gross as the blunder of the allies at Austerlitz.
Wellington instantly poured his troops down from behind the
Arapiles hill on to the lower ground about the village of the
same name, and formed in two lines, the right flanked by
cavalry. At the same time he ordered Pakenham to advance
against the line of march of the French left. Marmont saw
too late that he had been over hasty: the divisions which were
to form his centre were not yet on the ground. Wellington's
advance had brought him under a heavy fire from the
enemy's artillery ranged opposite him, and Marmont hoped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>that this might serve to check the English until he could
retrieve his mistake. It was too late: suddenly he saw
Pakenham's troops come into view and meet Thomi√®re's
long column of march, while two English batteries took it in
flank. Marmont personally was spared further effort, for a
shell struck him down with a broken arm and other wounds
as he descended from the Arapiles. The fall of the
commander increased the confusion, the more so as the
next in command was soon also wounded. The rout of
Thomi√®re's division was soon complete, and its commander
was killed. Wellington had only waited for Pakenham to
come well into action before advancing in the centre, at the
same time sending a brigade to assail the Arapiles hill held
by the French. The battle raged fiercely for a short time
along the front, where Clausel, on whom the command had
devolved, had now come up into line. The French left
was to all intents and purposes destroyed, partly by
Pakenham, partly by a grand charge of Le Marchant's
cavalry, which dashed forward from the right of the main
body. The centre and right kept up the conflict for some
time longer, all the better because the English attack on the
Arapiles had been heavily repulsed. The battle however
was lost, and Clausel had only to retreat as best he could.
This he managed with great skill, covering his rear with
clouds of skirmishers, until gradually his troops gained the
shelter of the forest from which they had emerged in the
forenoon with every prospect of victory. The oncoming
darkness prevented direct pursuit, but Wellington was little
concerned at this, for he had pushed forward on his left the
divisions that had formed his reserve towards the fords by
which alone the French could cross the Tormes, assuming
that the castle of Alba de Tormes was held by the Spanish
troops which he had placed there. The Spanish commander
had however evacuated the place on Marmont's
approach the previous day, and had carefully omitted to
inform Wellington. Hence the French were able to escape
by Alba with much less loss in prisoners than well might
have been. The French loss however was very serious:
out of about 42,000 men nearly 12,000 were killed,
wounded, or taken prisoners. Wellington had to pay the
heavy price of 6000 men out of 46,000 for his victory; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>by it he shook the French hold on Spain in every corner of
the country.</p>

<p>Though the defeated army was seriously disorganised
beyond its heavy losses, Clausel nevertheless tried to make
a stand beyond the Douro, in the expectation that king
Joseph, with the small army at his immediate disposal,
would there join him. Joseph was distracted between many
counsels, and consequently did not act promptly. Wellington
however decided the question for him. Forcing Clausel
from the Douro, he entered Valladolid, seizing the French
stores there. Then leaving a small force to face Clausel,
who had retreated towards Burgos, and who could not be in
a condition to resume offensive operations for some time,
Wellington turned upon Joseph, and easily drove him from
Madrid. The intruding king, after much hesitation, retired
eastwards, and sent positive orders to Soult to evacuate
Andalusia and bring his army to the east side of Spain.
The occupation of Madrid by Wellington involved the capture
of a vast quantity of French material of war, which they
found it difficult to replace; but the moral effects were incomparably
greater, as an encouragement to the Spanish
people. A great part of the north was already in a state of
insurrection, in spite of the presence of French troops: this
stroke stimulated them by the hope of speedy success, besides
setting the whole south free from the invaders. Wellington
was perfectly aware that his hold on Madrid could be but
temporary: as soon as Soult and Joseph were united, they
would have strength enough to compel him to retire. This
could not however take place immediately: so Wellington,
leaving Hill at Madrid, marched northwards, hoping to
inflict another blow on Clausel's army, now commanded by
Souham, in the time at his disposal. At Burgos he allowed
himself to be drawn into a siege of the castle, which was
bravely and skilfully defended, and proved impregnable to
field artillery, which was all that Wellington had with him.
The concentration of the enemy's armies in the east rendered
it impossible for him to maintain his position much longer.
Accordingly on October 21 he began for the last time a
retreat into Portugal, Hill also abandoning Madrid. The
latter part of the retreat had to be conducted in frightful
weather, and was marked by more disorder in the British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>army than occurred at any other time during the war; thus
the losses were severe, out of all proportion to the pressure
which the French were able to exercise.</p>

<p>Just at the time when Wellington turned his back on
Burgos, Napoleon's retreat from Moscow began. Before
the end of the year he was driven out of Russia, having lost
nearly half-a-million of men: Prussia also, hitherto his
nominal ally, rose in arms against him. In order to make
head against Russia and Prussia on the Elbe, he had to
withdraw troops from Spain, besides directing to Germany
reinforcements and supplies which otherwise might have
been devoted to the Spanish armies. Hence when the
campaign of 1813 began, Wellington had the superiority of
strength, though his enemies were now less widely scattered
than before the evacuation of Andalusia. There could be
no doubt that to invade Spain once more in the same general
direction as in 1812 would be the most effective. Even Sir
John Moore's small force, boldly plunging into Spain by
that route at the end of 1808, had made Napoleon fear for
his line of communication with France, and compelled
him to detach overwhelming forces against the English.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A fortiori</i> Wellington, advancing by that line with an army
equal to all that king Joseph could bring together, must
compel him to evacuate Madrid, and retreat sufficiently far
northwards to guard the main road to France. Wellington
knew by his experience of the last year that the line of the
Douro beyond Salamanca was difficult to force in the face
of a fairly equal enemy. He therefore resolved that a large
portion of his army should cross the Douro down in
Portugal, and then move eastwards, while he himself advanced
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vi√¢</i> Salamanca. The pressure of his left wing would
compel the French in his front to retire, for fear of being
completely outflanked. And here came in the advantage
which he derived from the English command of the sea.
Instead of dragging behind him an ever-lengthening chain, in
the shape of communication with Lisbon, which had hitherto
been his base for supplies, he could, if confident of having
the upper hand in the north-west of Spain, have his supplies
brought to the northern ports, and conveyed thence by
comparatively short journeys. And he was confident, so
thoroughly so as to let it be seen; it is told that when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a><br /><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>passed the frontier into Spain, he rose in his stirrups, and
looking round waved his hand, exclaiming: "Farewell,
Portugal!" During four weary years he had stood substantially
on the defensive, guarding the frontier if he could,
retreating if he could not, obliged to withdraw behind it
after incursions into Spain. Now at last his turn was come,
and he knew it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_b_230"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_230.jpg" width="400" height="583" alt="Map XV: Battle of Vittoria." />
</div>

<p>Wellington's movements were at the beginning so far
concealed that the French did not penetrate his purpose.
King Joseph did not understand that the game was substantially
lost, and hoped to concentrate the French armies
behind the Douro, and stop Wellington, if he could not
force him back to Portugal once more. Graham's divisions
appearing north of the Douro, and steadily pushing forwards,
undeceived him. The French retreated first to Burgos,
protecting as long as possible the vast amount of property
of all kinds which was being poured along the great high-road
to Bayonne, from the reserve artillery to the pictures
robbed from Spanish churches and palaces, all the treasure
and apparatus of the usurping government and court, all the
military stores which had accumulated during five years of
war, all the non-military persons who had so identified
themselves with the invaders that they dared not stay in
Spain. Wellington continued moving in the same manner,
pushing his left forward while with his right he followed up
the French, thus ever threatening to cut their communications,
ever securing the command of more and more of the
north coast. King Joseph found it necessary to retreat still
further, till at Vittoria he had to choose between abandoning
Spain altogether, and risking a battle. That he could have
fought with at least equal chances of success two or three
times, at earlier stages of the retreat, seems clear: but there
was no sound directing head at the French head-quarters.
Joseph was always incompetent, his military adviser, Marshal
Jourdan, was either over-ruled or failed even less excusably
because he had more experience; the subordinate generals
received vacillating orders. The whole machine in fact was
out of gear; though in the various combats, large and small,
generals and soldiers fought as well as ever, the army as a
whole expected to be beaten and was beaten.</p>

<p>The basin of Vittoria is about twelve miles in length,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>from the defile of Salinas, where the river Zadorra enters it
on the east, to the defile of Puebla, where the river quits it
to flow towards the Ebro. The great royal road, the only
one good enough for the enormous convoys with which the
French army was burdened, traversed these defiles, running
through the town of Vittoria on the south side of the river.
The basin is more or less completely surrounded with hills,
crossed by rough and difficult roads. To the west is the
valley of the small river Bayas, which converges towards the
Zadorra, joining the Ebro just above it. From the Bayas
there is a way into the basin of Vittoria by a gap in the hills
behind the village of Subijana de Morillos, four or five miles
from the Puebla defile. A dozen miles higher up the Bayas
the road from Bilbao crosses that stream, and threading the
defiles of the northern hills comes down straight on Vittoria.
The French, who were in fact to fight for the plunder of
Spain and the accumulated material of the army, had been
already weakened by large detachments sent forward in
charge of convoys. Outnumbered in fact, outweighed still
more in imagination, they were massed, except Reille's
divisions, at the western end of the basin, the plain behind
them being full of waggons of all descriptions. Reille was
posted north of Vittoria, facing the Bilbao road, so far from
the rest of the army that he could not possibly be supported
if attacked by superior numbers, though it is obvious that if
Reille were overpowered the great road would be lost.
Nothing could better illustrate the extreme unwisdom of
not standing to fight earlier: defeat at Vittoria meant the
loss of everything, and the dispositions made invited defeat.
Wellington fully realised his advantage: he sent Graham
with some 20,000 men up the Bayas, to cross into the basin of
Vittoria by the Bilbao road and attack Reille, while the rest
of the army attacked the main body of the French posted
behind the Zadorra at the west end of the basin.</p>

<p>At daybreak on June 21 Wellington's immediate right
under Hill moved forwards and slowly crossed the Zadorra
just below the defile of Puebla. There was no occasion for
haste, rather it was expedient to be leisurely, so as to give
time for Graham to accomplish his much longer march.
Then a brigade of Spanish infantry was sent to scale the
heights which form the eastern side of the defile, and push
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>along them so as to threaten to turn the French left. The
remainder of the right wing passed through the defile and
attacked the French left in front. Meanwhile Wellington
with his centre had made his way through and over the hills
separating the Bayas from the Zadorra, part by the gap of
Subijana de Morillos, so as to converge on Hill's force,
part some distance further to the northwards. By this time
it was one o'clock, and the distant sound of cannonading
told that Graham was already engaged. The French main
army began to retreat, pressed steadily in front by Wellington,
till they were driven back to within a mile of Vittoria. By
this time Graham, who had considerably larger forces than
those immediately opposed to him, had obtained command
of the royal road. Carrying out on a small scale in action
the same idea which had inspired Wellington's movements
on the large scale, he had pushed forwards his left, winning
possession of the village of Gamarra Mayor on Reille's
extreme right. The French here held their ground with
admirable tenacity, and Graham could seize neither the
bridge at Gamarra, nor that directly in his front by which
the Bilbao road enters Vittoria, though his guns could sweep
the great road towards France. Reille thus saved the French
army from annihilation: if he had been driven over the
Zadorra a comparatively small part would have been able
to escape at all. Thanks to him, the bulk of the soldiers
were able to retire by the Pampeluna road; but it could
scarcely be called an army. The losses in the battle, or
rather in the pair of simultaneous battles, had not been
exceptional, and had been tolerably equal, about 6000 killed
and wounded on each side; but nothing escaped except
the men. To quote the words of a French officer who took
part in the action: "They lost all their equipages, all their
guns, all their treasure, all their stores, all their papers, so
that no man could prove how much pay was due to him:
generals and soldiers alike were reduced to the clothes on
their backs, and most of them were barefoot."</p>

<p>The deliverance of Spain was not yet complete, but it
was virtually achieved by the battle of Vittoria. Before
Wellington could capture San Sebastian, the fortress which
guarded the Spanish side of the frontier at the extreme
south-west corner of France, Soult had been sent by Napoleon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>to reorganise the disordered fragments of several separate
commands which had escaped from Vittoria. As soon as
he could move, Soult crossed the passes of the western
Pyrenees, trying to break up the scattered parts of the
English army, which had to besiege San Sebastian and
Pampeluna, besides its other duties. Wellington was able
to concentrate just in time, and after some very complicated
warfare in the mountain country, involving serious losses on
both sides, Soult was driven back into France. Before the
end of the year Wellington was in France; he had stormed
San Sebastian, converted the siege of Pampeluna into a
blockade, driven Soult successively across the two little
rivers beyond the frontier, and surrounded Bayonne. The
fall of Napoleon early in 1814 put an end to the war, not
without two more battles, in the latter of which Soult was
driven from a very strong position close to the city of
Toulouse, while inflicting very great loss on his assailants.
Wellington had contributed largely to the overthrow of
Napoleon by his direct efforts, by his caution and foresight
so long as was necessary, by his daring at the right moment,
by his skilful and bold offensive strategy. How much he
contributed indirectly, by keeping up resistance to the
universal conqueror in one corner of Europe, it would be
difficult to estimate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>WATERLOO</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[NOTE.&mdash;Controversy has raged over almost every point of the Waterloo
campaign. Matters of fact have been disputed, whether or not given
things happened, and if they did happen, when and how. Still more
naturally have questions of inference and judgment been disputed,
under the influence of partisanship, or supposed patriotism, or preconceived
ideas. I have deemed it unnecessary to enter into any of
these controversies. I have narrated the facts as I believe them to
have occurred, without citing evidence, and have left doubtful inferences
to the reader. To have done more would have been inconsistent
with the scope of this book.]</p></div>


<p>The combined efforts of the great powers of Europe
overthrew Napoleon early in the year 1814. In spite of
amazing efforts on his part, the allied armies marched to
Paris; and the emperor, finding himself almost deserted,
was compelled to abdicate. The allied powers made the
great mistake, as events proved, of allowing him to take
possession in full sovereignty of the little island of Elba.
A man of more chivalrous spirit would probably have felt
that it was a mockery to call him emperor of so minute an
empire, and would have preferred to disappear entirely from
the observation of a world in which he had risen to so vast
a height and fallen so decisively. Napoleon took his small
kingdom seriously, and seems to have been contented for a
time, until reports of the state of affairs in France led him
to think that he might recover his throne. The legitimate line
of the Bourbon kings had been restored on Napoleon's overthrow,
in the person of Louis <abbr title="the Eighteenth">XVIII.</abbr>, brother of the king
executed in 1793. How far this restoration was acceptable at
the time to the French nation as a whole it is difficult to judge.
Certainly the knot of selfish politicians who seized the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>opportunity of speaking in the name of France desired it
for their own ends. Certainly also the allied sovereigns,
who for the moment held the fate of France in their hands,
most or all of them thought it the most desirable course in
the interests of Europe generally. But the Bourbons, like
their English forerunners in disaster, had learned nothing
and forgotten nothing. The great mass of Frenchmen had
no wish to lose the great fruits of the Revolution, abolition
of aristocratic privilege, limitation of the royal authority,
curtailment of the vast influence of the clergy. Still less
were they willing to see the crown and the royalist exiles
resume possession of the lands of which they had been deprived,
and which had mostly been sold to new owners.
Least of all were they inclined to allow the rejection, in
favour of the Bourbon white flag, of the tricolour which was
the emblem alike of the liberty and equality won by the
Revolution, and of the military glories won by Napoleon.
The king himself seems to have been at least willing to
abide by the constitution he had proclaimed, and to accept
the great social results of the Revolution; but his brother
and destined successor, and many of the restored exiles,
made no secret of their desire to revert to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ancien r√©gime</i>.
Naturally a large amount of discontent was engendered,
and of this Napoleon took advantage to try his luck once
more. On March 1, 1815, he landed near Cannes with a
few hundred followers. The population of the provinces
through which his way to Paris lay were on the whole
favourable, more so probably than the average of the whole
of France. The soldiers could nowhere be induced to fight
against the emperor; and many of the officers, though by
no means all, set them the example of defection. The king
fled into Belgium, and Napoleon marched to Paris in
triumph, and resumed the government without a blow.</p>

<p>The allied powers however were in no mind to see their
vast sacrifices thrown away, and to allow Napoleon the
chance of once more consolidating his power in France,
and beginning a fresh series of wars of aggression. Their
representatives were still assembled in congress at Vienna,
occupied in the difficult task of resettling Europe after the
universal removing of landmarks which had been produced
by the recent wars. They at once declared Napoleon a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>public enemy, and began preparations for launching
enormous hosts against him. Months must pass before, in
the then state of roads and modes of locomotion, a
single Russian soldier could be seen on the French frontier.
A shorter, but still considerable, interval must elapse before
the Austrian armies could take the field. But England was
only across the narrow seas, and Prussia held great territories
on the Rhine. Accordingly these two powers, acting in
concert, poured their troops, one army under Wellington,
the other under Blucher, into the new kingdom of the
Netherlands, which had but recently formed part of
Napoleon's empire. From the Belgian frontier starts the
easiest and shortest line of invasion of France, assuming
invasion to be directed at the capital. And the intention
was that the English and Prussian armies should take this
route, when the Austrians had reached the eastern frontier,
and the Russians were getting within supporting distance.
Napoleon no doubt realised that his game was lost if his
enemies once gathered in their irresistible numbers. At any
rate he saw plainly enough that his best chance lay in
defeating his opponents piecemeal. Could he succeed in
destroying the Anglo-Prussian army, the other powers might
be intimidated, or possibly bribed, into letting him alone.
The indications are that this would never have happened;
the Czar would probably have receded before nothing
but overwhelming defeat, and the overthrow of Wellington
and Blucher would not have meant the annihilation of the
power of Prussia, still less of Great Britain. Nevertheless
Napoleon had a chance in this way, and in no other, and he
proceeded to try it with characteristic vigour and resolution,
though with less than his usual skill and care when the
actual stress came.</p>

<p>In order that the campaign may be understood, of which
Waterloo was the climax, it must be always remembered
that political reasons rendered it essential for Napoleon to
assume the offensive in spite of inferior numbers, and
offered every inducement to the allies to await attack, and
also that this gave Napoleon the great strategical advantage
of the initiative. The allies had to guard the Belgian
frontier; he could select his own point for invasion. Accordingly
the allies occupied a line from east to west, some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>thirty miles south of Brussels, and a little north of the
actual frontier. The Prussians on the eastern half lay
chiefly on the north side of the Meuse and its tributary the
Sambre.</p>

<p>Wellington's army was only a third English, another third
being Dutch-Belgians of very poor quality and doubtful
fidelity,<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> the remainder Germans, some of them excellent
troops, the rest mere recruits. He covered the western part
of the frontier, as was natural, seeing that he drew his supplies
from England by the Belgian ports of Ostend and
Antwerp. The two armies met just south of Brussels,
near Charleroi, where a main road crosses the Sambre. The
allies could not of course know by what route Napoleon, if
he assumed the offensive, as was probable, would enter
Belgium. They therefore had to watch the whole line; and
partly for this reason, partly for convenience of subsistence,
they quartered their forces over a space of country fully
100 miles in length from east to west. On the Prussian
side, where the rivers formed a protection, and where there
was less reason to expect attack, the troops were comparatively
near the frontier line. On the English side none except
outposts were close to the frontier, and some were at least
thirty miles behind it.</p>

<p>Napoleon could bring into the field about 125,000 men,
practically all veterans commanded by excellent officers,
though the successive re-organisations after his first overthrow
and on his restoration had left it lacking in the
perfect mutual confidence of officers and men which makes
a veteran army so formidable. Of these nearly 24,000 were
cavalry; and there were 344 field guns. The Prussians
under Blucher were not much inferior in numbers to the
French, about 121,000, but their proportion of cavalry
(12,000) and guns (312) was lower, and the quality of part
at least of the army inferior. Wellington had about 94,000
men, of whom over 14,000 were cavalry, with 196 guns,
but, as has been said before, barely half<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> of them were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>really trustworthy troops. Thus Napoleon was nearly
equal to his opponents in number of cavalry, but was outmatched
in guns in the proportion of about three to two,
and in infantry by at least seven to four, though the superior
quality of his troops went some way towards compensating
for this inequality. He had the further advantage of unity
of command, while the armies of the allies not only were
separate, with no further concert of action than what the
voluntary accord of the chiefs might establish, but drew
their supplies from opposite directions, the Prussians from
the Rhine, the English from the Belgian ports. Both sides
seem to have been fairly well informed as to the strength of
the other. Napoleon also had information as to the position
of the allied troops, nor were Wellington and Blucher quite
in the dark when the French troops concentrated on the
frontier, skilfully as Napoleon had arranged their movements,
though they could not at first be certain what was
real attack, what feint.</p>

<p>Napoleon had practically a choice between two plans.
He might invade Belgium on the west, opposite the right of
Wellington's widely divided army, and by advancing northwards
cut Wellington off from his communication with the
sea. This was what Wellington expected; he was very
anxious about his supplies, being probably more than
doubtful whether his army would find subsistence if compelled
to depend on the Prussians, who had quite enough
to do in supplying their own army. A corresponding
movement on the left of the Prussians was obviously
possible, but for many reasons not worth Napoleon's while.
The alternative plan, which he adopted, and which all
critics consider to have been the best open to him, was to
concentrate his army due south of Brussels, at the nearest
point to that capital, and cross the Sambre at Charleroi,
which would bring him on the point where the English and
Prussian armies met. Napoleon knew that the Prussian
forces were less dispersed, and generally nearer the frontier
than those of Wellington. He therefore calculated that if,
as was probable, Blucher concentrated his army for battle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>it would be at a point comparatively near to Charleroi, and
that Wellington could not be in time to give him serious
assistance. He further calculated that Blucher, if defeated,
would retreat eastwards in the direction of his proper line of
communication, and that then Wellington ought to be an
easy prey to the French army, superior in both numbers and
quality.</p>

<p>Accordingly Napoleon issued orders that his whole army
should move at dawn on June 15, and cross the Sambre at
or near Charleroi. At the same time he ordered slight
demonstrations to be made much further west, in the neighbourhood
of Mons, in order that Wellington might be kept
as long as possible in doubt as to what Napoleon's real
purpose was. Ziethen, who commanded the Prussian corps
nearest to Charleroi, had unaccountably taken no steps to
destroy the bridges over the Sambre, which would have
delayed the French greatly: but he disputed their advance
with much skill and pertinacity, and slowly retired north-eastwards
to Fleurus. Blucher had on the night of June
14, on receiving certain tidings that the French were in
great force beyond the Sambre, ordered his whole army to
concentrate at Sombref, four or five miles behind Fleurus, at
the point where the road from Charleroi crosses the great
high-road that runs a little north of west from Namur to
Nivelles, and thence towards the coast. It was at this
point that it had been agreed between the allies, some
weeks before, that the Prussians should concentrate in case
of an advance by Napoleon, which they then thought improbable.
One of the four Prussian corps, that of Bulow,
was at a great distance, and failed to arrive in time; but
those of Pirch and Thielemann duly joined Ziethen. On
the 16th Blucher, with nearly 90,000 men, took up a position
at Ligny, a mile or so south of the great Namur road, and
awaited attack. Napoleon's intention had been to bring
his whole army across the Sambre on the 15th, to occupy
Fleurus in force, in anticipation of battle with Blucher, and
to send a detachment to Quatre-Bras, where the Charleroi-Brussels
road crosses the Namur-Nivelles road, in order to
intercept the main line of communication between Wellington
and Blucher. This was only approximately carried out: at
nightfall, some French divisions were still on the wrong side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>of the Sambre. Quatre-Bras was found to be occupied, and
the French left therefore did not go beyond Frasne, two or
three miles to the south; and Ziethen's rear-guard still held
Fleurus. The difference was of no serious consequence,
the less so as the allied generals played into Napoleon's
hands, Blucher by committing himself to battle with only
three-fourths of his army and with no assurance of assistance
from his colleague, Wellington by his slowness in concentrating
his army. The English general, ill served as to
intelligence, only heard the news of the French advance in
the afternoon: even then, slow to abandon his belief that
Napoleon would try to cut him off from the sea, he only
warned his troops to be ready. In the evening he ordered
concentration on Nivelles, and not till the morning of the
16th did he direct movements on Quatre-Bras.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>On the morning of June 16 Napoleon was in no hurry
to move. He had entrusted Ney with the command of his
left wing, and given him orders to attack the English at
Quatre-Bras. There was much delay, which seems attributable
partly to Ney's doing nothing to hasten the march
(he had only joined the army on the 15th and had no
staff), and partly to the remissness of the corps commanders,
Reille and D'Erlon. About two o'clock however
he began, with Reille's corps only, the battle of Quatre-Bras.
It was extremely fortunate for Wellington that Ney
had not moved earlier, for the position at daybreak was
only held by one brigade, and it was but slowly that fresh
troops came up. At first the French seemed likely to
carry all before them: the Dutch-Belgian troops suffered
severely, and some of them fled. No reader of <cite>Vanity
Fair</cite> can have forgotten Thackeray's description of the
panic caused in Brussels by the arrival of these fugitives,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>reporting that the allied army was cut to pieces. The
Brunswick division was also broken for the time, and their
duke killed.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> But reinforcements came up in succession,
and Wellington, who was on the field in person, grew
relatively stronger as evening approached, and foiled every
effort Ney made. Why Ney did not make greater efforts,
why especially he made so little use of his cavalry, of which
arm Wellington had very few on the field, is hard to say.
Possibly his Peninsular experiences made him feel convinced
that Wellington would not risk a battle without
adequate strength. Certainly the woods interfered with his
seeing fully the amount of Wellington's force. The absence
of D'Erlon's corps was, as will appear presently, no fault of
his, except so far as he was responsible for not having
brought D'Erlon up to the front in the morning. At any
rate he failed: at nightfall on the 16th the French were at
Frasne, the English at Quatre-Bras, as they had been on
the night of the 15th; only each side had lost between
4000 and 5000 men, the English rather more than the
French.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Napoleon had taken for granted that Ney
would be able to dislodge the English,<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and had not only
told him how far to advance on the Brussels road, but had
also ordered him to despatch part of his troops, as soon as
Quatre-Bras was occupied, down the Namur road, to co-operate
in his own attack on the Prussians. He had waited
until Ney was engaged before beginning his own battle,
which he did not doubt winning, and hoped by Ney's aid
to render decisive. On the Prussian left Thielemann's
corps covered the road to Namur: the centre and right,
formed by Ziethen's corps, with Pirch in second line, were
thrown forward almost at a right angle to the left, behind
the villages of Ligny and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Amand, so as to cover the
same road further west, by which communication was to be
kept up with Wellington. The duke had seen Blucher in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>the morning, and had promised to assist the Prussians if
not himself attacked. Thus both French and Prussians
were hoping at least for help from Quatre-Bras, which
neither combatant there was in any condition to afford.
Napoleon decided to begin by assailing the Prussian right:
for this he had every motive, as it was unprotected by any
natural obstacle, and success there would not only tend to
separate Blucher from Wellington, but would also drive
Blucher to retreat towards Namur, which Napoleon naturally
desired. His plan however aimed at a much more
decisive stroke. He had determined, after the Prussian
right had been shaken by some hours of fighting, to assail
the centre with his reserve. If that attack succeeded, and
one of Ney's corps took the Prussians in rear, as was to be
done when Quatre-Bras had been won, half of the Prussian
army would be virtually surrounded, and must either be
destroyed or surrender. The fighting all through was of a
most desperate character, but the French had, on the whole,
the best of it, and Napoleon was preparing for his attack
on the centre, when the news that a considerable body of
troops were in sight a couple of miles or so on his left,
naturally caused him to wait. They might be Wellington's,
in which case caution was obviously expedient: they might
be Ney's expected succour appearing in the wrong place,
in which case time would be needed for them to work
round the flank of the Prussians. It had just been ascertained
that the approaching troops were French, when they
suddenly halted and began to return the way they had
come. They were D'Erlon's corps, which had been on
their way to join Ney, and had been directed towards the
field of Ligny, apparently by a staff officer who thought he
was rightly interpreting Napoleon's wishes. Ney, on hearing
what had happened, very properly recalled D'Erlon:
his orders were to dislodge the English from Quatre-Bras,
which he could not do without D'Erlon's troops, and then,
but not till then, to reinforce Napoleon. The result however
was that D'Erlon's corps wasted the day in marching
to and fro, and took part in neither battle, though its
active co-operation ought to have been decisive on either
field.</p>

<p>Sunset was approaching, and Napoleon, seeing that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>was too late to send effective orders after D'Erlon, made
his attack on the Prussian centre as before arranged. Its
success gave him an undoubted victory, but dearly bought,
and not overwhelming. The Prussians were able to retreat
unmolested under cover of the darkness, leaving behind
them over 20,000 men, killed, wounded and prisoners, or
about a third of the two corps, Ziethen's and Pirch's, on
which the stress of the fighting had fallen. The French
army bivouacked on the field how they could: their loss
had amounted to 11,000 or 12,000 men.</p>

<p>Thus up to nightfall on June 16 Napoleon had gained
considerable success. He had attained his first object, of
engaging and defeating Blucher before Wellington could
come to his assistance, and might reasonably expect to
attain his second object, of attacking Wellington with his
main force while separated from the Prussians, in which
case with a superior army he ought to win a decisive victory.
That more had not been achieved was due to the delay on
the French left, which neutralised the advantage resulting
from Wellington's undue slowness in concentrating his army.
As often happens in war, one mistake but cancelled the
other. On the 17th most part of the advantage which
the French possessed over the allies was lost, largely by
Napoleon's own fault, partly by the loyal co-operation of
Blucher and Wellington. Critics who treat war like a game
of chess, and forget that soldiers are men who must eat and
sleep, say that Napoleon ought to have started at daybreak,
to take Wellington at Quatre-Bras in flank, while Ney
renewed the attack in front. But the emperor himself was
exhausted by two extremely long and fatiguing days: nor
could even the troops that had taken but little part in a
battle ending at 9.30 p.m. be expected to be in marching
order again in six hours. Napoleon made the grievous
mistake of taking for granted two things, both of them
likely, but neither of them in fact true. First he more or
less assumed that Wellington, informed of the result of the
battle of Ligny, would have retreated, leaving only a rearguard
at Quatre-Bras; if this were so, there was no use in
Napoleon's trying to attack him. As a matter of fact,
Wellington did not receive the news of Ligny till the
morning of the 17th, and he then waited to exchange communications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
with Blucher before ordering a retreat, for
which there was no immediate hurry, unless the French
resumed the offensive. Napoleon's other and far more
disastrous mistake was taking for granted that Blucher had
retreated on Namur, that is to say straight away from his
ally. As a matter of fact the Prussians were retreating
northwards on Wavre, true to the general agreement between
Blucher and Wellington that they would co-operate as
thoroughly as possible; and since that movement was
ordered, news had come from Wellington that he was on
the point of retreating on Waterloo, and would stand to
fight there if assured of assistance from one Prussian corps.
Napoleon had plenty of cavalry available, for Ligny was
essentially an infantry battle, and certainly ought to have
pushed cavalry along every road by which the Prussians
could possibly have retreated. If they were gone eastwards,
as he hoped and believed, all was plain sailing: if
they were gone north, they might still unite with Wellington,
and the game was by no means won. As it was, he contented
himself with one reconnaissance along the Namur
road, which confirmed him in his error by capturing a few
stragglers, and so threw away the advantages gained already
by his skilfully-devised plan of campaign.</p>

<p>In the course of the morning of the 17th, Wellington
withdrew his forces from Quatre-Bras, and retreated to the
position at Waterloo which he had noted the year before, as
an excellent one for a defensive battle to protect Brussels.
In the afternoon heavy rain came on, which lasted all night,
soaking the ground, seriously injuring the roads, and thus
interfering with the march of the French, who followed at
some distance. By nightfall the French were in front of
Wellington's position; and both armies bivouacked on the
wet ground, no very favourable preparation for the work of
the morrow. Before moving from Ligny with the guard and
Lobau's corps, to unite them to the troops under Ney, and
with the whole body follow up the retreating English,
Napoleon had given his orders for the pursuit of the defeated
Prussians. Marshal Grouchy was put at the head of
the two corps, Vandamme's and G√©rard's, on which the
stress of the fighting at Ligny had fallen, which with some
cavalry amounted to about 33,000 men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Napoleon after the event attempted to make Grouchy
entirely responsible for the loss of the battle of Waterloo,
and Napoleon's partisans have followed his example. A
few writers have exempted Grouchy from all blame: the
majority of reasonably impartial critics blame him more or
less severely, though without holding Napoleon faultless.
In any case the absence of Grouchy at Waterloo, without
his thereby preventing Blucher from participating, was a
decisive fact, however it was brought about. Hence it is
necessary to understand clearly what his intentions were,
and what was the discretionary power left to him. In personal
conversation Napoleon told Grouchy that he was
himself going to fight the English "if they will stand on
this side of the forest of Soignies," and ordered him to
pursue the Prussians and complete their defeat by attacking
them as soon as he came up with them: and it is clear that
he then still supposed the Prussians to have retreated on
Namur, and therefore that the pursuit of them was not a
matter of primary importance. Afterwards he heard news
which implied the probability that part at least of the
Prussian army might have gone further north: and he sent
Grouchy written orders to take his forces to Gembloux
(N.E. from Ligny), explore in the direction of Namur and
of Maestricht (still further to N.E.), and find out what the
Prussians were doing, whether they were or were not intending
to unite with the English, to cover Brussels or Li√®ge,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
and try another battle. These orders still treat as most
probable the separation of the Prussians from Wellington,
but they contemplate the other possibility&mdash;they do not
however tell Grouchy what to do in that event. Unfortunately
for Napoleon, Grouchy was without experience in
independent command, of rather limited range of ideas,
and sharing the abject dread of disobeying Napoleon which
cramped the energy and clouded the judgment, at times if
not always, of most of his generals. He was capable
enough, as he showed when left altogether to himself after
the rout of Waterloo; but so long as he was under
Napoleon's orders, he dared not think for himself. Grouchy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>accordingly marched to Gembloux: and having ascertained
beyond further doubt that the Prussians had not gone to
Namur, but that part of them had gone north to Wavre,
and the main body as he believed north-eastward towards
Maestricht, he reported this late at night to Napoleon,
adding his intention to follow the enemy, if it turned out
after all that they were moving on Wavre, "in order to
prevent their gaining Brussels and to separate them from
Wellington." As a matter of fact, the whole Prussian army
had gained Wavre, in accordance with the agreement
between Blucher and Wellington, in order to be able to
support Wellington on the next day. That there existed
between the two allied generals a substantial and hearty
accord is certain enough, though Gneisenau, who was
Blucher's chief of staff, always suspicious of Wellington,
was inclined to doubt his sincerity, and to take care of the
Prussian army only, not of the common cause. These
suspicions were in fact groundless, and were very bad policy
also; Gneisenau reminds one of a whist-player who plays
for his own hand and will not co-operate with his partner, a
style of play which is equivalent to giving the other side
odds. That Gneisenau was overruled, that the co-operation
was carried through to a triumphant end, was due to
Marshal Blucher personally, a man far inferior to Gneisenau
in military ability, but stanch to the backbone, and moreover
hating the French with a keen personal hatred.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th Grouchy moved on Wavre:
the hour named for starting was not a very early one, as it
would have been if Grouchy had deemed time of great importance;
and the troops, doubtless still feeling the effects
of Ligny, in spite of an easy day's work on the 17th, were
slow to get into motion. About eleven o'clock, while Grouchy
was halting to eat at Walhain, about one-third of the way to
Wavre, the opening cannonade of the battle of Waterloo
was heard. General G√©rard at once urged him to "march
towards the cannon," and a vehement discussion arose,
which ended in Grouchy deciding to obey what he averred
to be the emperor's orders, and continue his march on
Wavre. That Grouchy ought to have crossed the Dyle at
once, cannot reasonably be doubted: if Blucher gave large
assistance to Wellington, the emperor must be overwhelmed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>and there was no means of preventing this, if Grouchy failed
in achieving it. True, Blucher might not be sending any
large force across from Wavre to Waterloo, but if he were
not, Grouchy would have discovered this eventually, and
might have pushed on Wavre as easily from the south-west
as from the south. If however, as was actually the case,
the bulk of the Prussian army was moving to support
Wellington and take the French in flank, there would be
little compensation for Napoleon's total defeat to be derived
from a slight success of Grouchy at Wavre. The marshal
however could not rise to the opportunity, he dared not
depart from what he understood to be the purpose of his
master. And it may pretty confidently be conjectured that in
a different case, had Napoleon beaten Wellington before
Blucher could come up, and had Grouchy's march towards
the cannon left it feasible for Blucher to unite with
Wellington before Brussels, Grouchy would have been blamed
without mercy.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether Grouchy, acting on G√©rard's
advice, could have saved the defeat of Waterloo. He had to
take 33,000 men with all their guns and ammunition waggons
across the river Dyle, by two bridges, one narrow and steep,
the other of wood and presumably not strong enough for
artillery. He had to march fourteen or fifteen miles by
very bad country roads, rendered much worse by the rain.
The Prussians from Wavre had a shorter distance to go
with no river to cross, and the foremost corps, Bulow's, had
considerably the start: the head of his column was in sight
of the battle-field when Grouchy's resolution was taken.
Moreover one corps, Ziethen's, took a parallel road further
to the north, entirely out of Grouchy's reach. It is pretty
certain that if Grouchy had marched on Waterloo, he would
have prevented Pirch's corps, which followed Bulow's, from
taking part in the battle, and so would have rendered the
rout a little less absolute. It is pretty certain also that
Bulow need have taken no notice of him, but it is not so
clear that he might not have been sufficiently disquieted by
Grouchy's appearance to think it expedient to turn back and
encounter him. Blucher however was with Bulow's corps,
and he was eager to press forward, at whatever cost. If
Napoleon had been in Blucher's place, he would have seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>that the defeat of the enemy's main army was of primary
importance, and would have taken his chance of Grouchy
achieving some success against the Prussians left behind.
It is however unprofitable to conjecture what might have
been. Happily for Wellington and for Europe, Grouchy was
afraid to face the responsibility, and marched on Wavre.
Here, to finish his story, he encountered Thielemann's
corps, left to play against him the very game which
Napoleon intended him to play against the whole Prussian
army, to detain and occupy as much as possible a superior
force. There was some fighting on the evening of the 18th,
and again on the next morning, to the advantage of the
French. But when Grouchy heard of the total defeat of the
emperor, he naturally thought only of regaining France.
His retreat was conducted with skill and audacity, and
ended, thanks to the protection afforded him in crossing the
Meuse by the fortifications of Namur, in his reaching French
territory with his army unbroken.</p>

<p>When Napoleon and Wellington stood at length face to
face on the night of June 17, both were naturally anxious
about the morrow, but in singularly different ways. The
emperor, justly believing that his army was the better of the
two, was only afraid that Wellington might yet rob him of
victory by decamping in the dark; and this fear haunted
him so obstinately that in the middle of the night, and
again at daybreak, he rode out to satisfy his own eyes that
the English army was still in position. Strangely enough
he does not seem to have been at all apprehensive of the
contingency which in fact happened to his ruin: he still
supposed the Prussian army out of reach. On the morning
of the 18th he sent a despatch to Grouchy, which accepted
as the right thing to be done that general's intention of
marching on Wavre. Not till eleven a.m., when the battle
was on the point of beginning, did he send a regiment<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> of
cavalry towards the bridges by which Grouchy would have
had to cross the Dyle, as if that were a chance worth taking
account of. But he took no steps to secure Grouchy's
coming, till the first Prussian troops were in sight,<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>certainly would have done had he seriously feared Blucher
taking him in flank. And this reduplication of the grievous
mistake he had made on the field of Ligny was absolutely
fatal.</p>

<p>Wellington on the other hand had fully made up his mind
to fight, in spite of the great risk he ran of being overwhelmed
before the Prussians could reach him, assuming
always that Blucher would come to his assistance. How
great that risk was, it is a little hard to realise after the
event. He could have no knowledge of the amount of
Grouchy's army, though he may well have guessed that
Napoleon had detached some troops to observe the Prussians.
For all he knew the French might be outnumbering
him considerably, the more so as he still deemed it necessary
to guard his right by leaving a large force at Hal, some ten
or twelve miles off. Napoleon made a miscalculation, as
most critics think, in giving Grouchy so large a force. If
Grouchy was merely to follow up the Prussians retreating
eastwards, less would suffice: if the emperor was to encounter
at Waterloo the allied armies united, he needed every man.
And Wellington made a similar miscalculation in leaving
18,000 men at Hal: if he was beaten at Waterloo, there
would be no longer a flank to guard; if he was successful, a
French detachment sent to turn his flank would have great
difficulty in escaping destruction. Even on the assumption
that Wellington knew the strength of the army facing him,
he was outmatched so long as he stood alone: and what was
his security for being supported? It has been said already
that he and Blucher acted cordially together, but there was
not, and could not be, a common plan of action worked out
in detail. The very fact that they had to await attack,
wherever Napoleon might assail them, rendered any such
elaborate concert impossible. Moreover Wellington was
doubtless aware that Gneisenau would be slow to take a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>course that endangered the Prussians. If after all the
Prussians were not coming, there was yet time to retreat
from an untenable position. Under the pressure of this
anxiety, Wellington is said to have spent a great part of the
night in riding over to Wavre and back, in order to see
Blucher and make sure. Whatever passed at that interview,<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
the duke was satisfied, and on the fateful morning of the
18th, his troops stood to their arms in the stations already
assigned to them.</p>

<p>The field of Waterloo has probably been visited by
more travellers than any other battle-field in the world:
but its aspect has been changed in some respects since
1815, so that the description to be given of it will not
be found to tally exactly with what is to be seen to-day.
Wellington's army was posted on a slight ridge, running
about east and west, and occupied a front of over two miles.
The ridge is crossed about the centre of the position by the
high road from Charleroi to Brussels, and a country road
runs along it, a little below the top on the southern side.
Less than three miles to the northward the Brussels road
enters the forest of Soignies; and Wellington calculated
that this would protect him in case of defeat. There were
roads enough to withdraw the artillery, &amp;c.; and the forest,
being thick but free of underwood, would present no
obstacle to infantry retiring, and would assist them in keeping
off pursuit. At the extreme western end of the ridge
lies a small village called Merbe Braine, somewhat sunk in
a hollow: this protected Wellington's extreme right from
being easily turned. The front of his right was covered by
the ch√¢teau of Hougomont, a good-sized country house with
gardens and orchard, enclosed by a wall. This lay down in
the valley separating the two armies; and it is obvious that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>no attack could be made on Wellington's right unless the
assailants had first seized this ch√¢teau, while on the other
hand their possession of Hougomont would have given them
great facilities for further advance. Similarly, in advance of
Wellington's left, lay two farms, La Haye and Papelotte,
and a little hamlet called Smohain, but the ground gave no
protection to the left flank of the position. Close to the
Charleroi-Brussels road, near the bottom of the slope lies
the farm of La Haye Sainte; this also formed some little
protection to the centre. The ground was practically all
open, and the slope down into the little valley that divided
the two armies before the battle not very steep, but still an
unmistakable descent. The slope up the opposite side was at
about the same inclination, so that the fronts of the two armies,
a little over three-quarters of a mile apart, lay on two roughly
parallel ridges. The English ridge was narrow enough for it
to be feasible to place the troops, when not actually standing
to repel attack, on the reverse or northern slope leading
towards the village of Waterloo, so that they were partially
sheltered from the French artillery. To complete the
picture of Wellington's position, it is necessary to add that
the road which runs along it leads to Ohain and thence to
Wavre: this was one of the routes by which Prussian succour
might come, and was in fact the road by which Ziethen
arrived shortly before the close of the battle. The shortest
way from Wavre, by which the first Prussians came, leads
through the valley and up against the eastern end of the
French line.</p>

<p>The position was an excellent one for defence, considering
the range of artillery and infantry fire of that date, and
would have fully compensated for the slight advantage of
numbers which Napoleon possessed, had the quality of the
two armies been equal. They were substantially equal in
infantry, a little under 50,000 each: but Napoleon had 15,000
cavalry as against 12,000, and many more guns, 246 to 156.
Wellington however could not place much reliance on the
Dutch-Belgian contingent, nearly 18,000 strong. The sympathies
of many of them were with the French, and none of
them had seen service, unless perchance in the emperor's
army before his first abdication. Consequently the duke
thought it expedient to distribute these troops among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>English and Germans: he would obviously have done
better, assuming that he was convinced of the necessity of
leaving a strong body at Hal, to have posted none but
Dutch and Belgians there, the more so as the command at
Hal was entrusted to a Dutch prince, and to have had
Colville's English on the field of Waterloo.</p>

<p>Wellington's army was distributed as follows, the front
being generally behind the country road from Wavre. On
the extreme left, which was unprotected by any natural
features, were two brigades of light cavalry, Vivian's and
Vandeleur's. Next came two Hanoverian brigades, Vincke's
and Best's: then, a little further back, Pack's brigade consisting
of the 1st, 42nd, 44th and 92nd British regiments.
To the right of Pack, extending as far as the high road,
was Kempt's brigade, comprising the 28th, 32nd, 79th and
1st battalion 95th. A Dutch-Belgian division was posted
in front of this, the left half of the line. One brigade
occupied the hamlet and farms that partially protected
the front: the other, Bylandt's, was posted on the slope
facing the south, where it was exposed to crushing fire
from the French artillery, which so shook it that early in the
battle it gave way, retired in confusion over the ridge, and
could be used no more. This was almost the only mistake
made by Wellington in the actual tactics of the battle: one
other only can be cited against him, and that as it happened
was in the same part of the field. The farm of La Haye Sainte,
a large courtyard with solid walls and buildings round it, just
on the high road and protecting the very centre of the whole
position, was garrisoned but slightly, and was not prepared
for defence, nor were the troops in it supplied, as they should
have been, with ample stores of ammunition. La Haye
Sainte was garrisoned from one of two German brigades,
Ompteda's and Kielmansegge's, which lay immediately to
the right of the high road. Next to them came Sir Colin
Halkett's English, these three brigades forming Count Alten's
division. To the right, more or less behind Hougomont,
and furnishing a great part of its garrison, was posted
General Cooke's division, consisting of Maitland's and Byng's
brigades of guards. To the right of the guards, Mitchell's
English brigade lined the cross road which runs north-west
from near Hougomont to Braine-la-Leud, a couple of miles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>off, where a Belgian division was posted; they thus guarded
the right of the position. In rear of the guards lay Clinton's
division, one brigade of which, Adam's, played a very
important part in the last stage of the battle: this division
was well placed to act as a reserve for any part of the line.
The regular reserve of about 10,000 men, of which over one-third
were cavalry, was placed a mile or so in rear of the
centre. The rest of the cavalry formed a second line in rear
of the right and centre, the heavy cavalry, Somerset's brigade
of guards and Ponsonby's Union brigade (the Royal
Dragoons, Scots Greys, and Inniskillings), being close to
right and left of the high road. The artillery was not
massed together after the fashion which has generally prevailed
in recent wars; the field batteries were distributed
along the front, in the proportion of about one battery to
each brigade, and the horse artillery was similarly joined to
the cavalry. It remains to add that Hougomont had been
very fully prepared for defence. The entire property, about
one-third of a mile square, was generally enclosed only with
hedges: but the farmyard and garden adjoining the house
in the north-west corner had good walls: and the orchard at
the north-east had also a wall on the north, which enabled
the defenders to drive the French out of the orchard again,
when once they penetrated to it.</p>

<p>As the French army were the assailants, it is needless to
describe with any particularity their original formation. The
first line, consisting of D'Erlon's corps on the right, and
Reille's on the left, faced the English on rather a longer
extent, with their powerful artillery ranged in front of the
infantry, their left being thrown rather forward so as to enwrap
Hougomont. Behind were the cavalry in a double
line. On the Charleroi road, in rear of the centre, Lobau's
corps was drawn up in close columns. Further back again
was Napoleon's guard of all arms to serve as the last reserve.
About half a mile to the east of the position of the guard,
nearly a mile behind the right front of the French, is the
village of Planchenoit: it is obvious that when late in the
battle the Prussians reached Planchenoit, they were attacking
the French at a most dangerous point, as they threatened to
cut off nearly the whole army, for which the Charleroi road
was the only line of retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>If Napoleon had even surmised that one Prussian corps
had started at daybreak to join Wellington, and that two
others were to follow, he would assuredly have begun the
battle of Waterloo some hours earlier than he in fact did.
The rain had ceased in the night, but the ground was
soaked, and the artillery could hardly move until it had
dried a little. The emperor, confident of victory, was in
no hurry. To quote his own account given at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Helena&mdash;At
eight o'clock, during his breakfast, the emperor said:
"The enemy's army is superior in numbers by at least one-fourth;<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
nevertheless we have at least ninety chances in a
hundred in our favour." Ney at this moment came up to
announce that Wellington was in full retreat.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> "You are
mistaken," replied the emperor, "he has no longer time,
he would expose himself to certain destruction." About nine
o'clock the French army began to take up its position for
the coming battle. Every movement was visible to the
English line, and formed a superb spectacle: indeed it is
suggested that Napoleon expected by this display, which
continued for some two hours before the signal was given,
to impress the Belgians in Wellington's army, already half-hearted
to say the least. There was always a touch of the
theatrical in Napoleon's character, and it came out conspicuously
before this, his last battle. To Wellington, who relied
for victory on the co-operation of the Prussians, still a long
way off, every minute's delay must have been an additional
reason for trusting that his bold venture would succeed.</p>

<p>The battle began at 11.30 with a cannonade along the
whole line, and an attack on Hougomont made by a division
of Reille's corps commanded by Napoleon's brother
Jerome. It is obvious that, whatever the general plan of the
battle might be, Hougomont, which projected like a bastion
from Wellington's line, must be attacked, if only to prevent
its garrison from firing into the flank of any columns that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>might assail the English centre. But it is also obvious that
Hougomont, unless weakly held, could not be taken except
at very great cost, and that success there would not be
nearly so valuable as elsewhere. Every man lost in assailing
Hougomont, beyond what was necessary for keeping the
English right employed, was wasted. But Reille, and the
generals under him, failed to realise this, and the whole of
the corps was drawn into the conflict. The fighting was of
the most desperate character, especially at first, and was
renewed at intervals, but the French never succeeded in
penetrating the house or walled garden. Hougomont was
in fact worth many thousands of men to Wellington.</p>

<p>The map shows plainly that the part of Wellington's line
where a successful attack would be most ruinous was near
the centre. A comparatively small part of his army stood
east of the high-road: if the centre could be pierced, the left
might be destroyed, and the right, cut off from the great road,
would have to retreat how it could, leaving the way to
Brussels open, and losing all chance of connection with
Blucher. Wellington's reserves were naturally behind the
centre: but it was here if anywhere that the French could
gain the battle, and it was here, as it happened, that Wellington
had failed to utilise La Haye Sainte. During the
first two hours of the battle the French merely cannonaded
this part of the line: their artillery was half as strong again
as the English, but the infantry were partially protected by
lying down on the northern side of the ridge they held, and
were not seriously shaken, except Bylandt's brigade.</p>

<p>About 1.30 began the first great attack on the English
centre, the whole of D'Erlon's corps advancing together.
Durutte's division on the right succeeded in getting temporary
possession of Papelotte. Donzelot on the left seized
the orchard and garden of La Haye Sainte, and a body of
heavy cavalry on his left flank nearly destroyed a Hanoverian
battalion that attempted to reinforce the farm. The two
centre divisions, with Donzelot's second brigade on their left
and a little ahead, advanced in columns of unusually close
and cumbrous formation. Bylandt's brigade gave way in
confusion, but Kempt's and Pack's stood firm in their
places. As the French halted close to the English line, and
attempted to deploy, Picton, who commanded the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>division, ordered Kempt's brigade to fire a volley, and charge.
Picton was shot dead, but the left column of the French was
driven back in utter rout. Meanwhile Marcognet's division
was pressing Pack hard, and Alix's was forcing its way
between Kempt and Pack. At this juncture Lord Uxbridge
ordered forward the English heavy cavalry. The household
brigade charged the French cuirassiers as they came up the
slope from La Haye Sainte, and completely defeated them.
The Union brigade charged and drove back with great loss
the French divisions which were pressing on, but which in
their crowded formation were almost helpless against cavalry
well led. Continuing its career, Ponsonby's brigade attacked
the French artillery on the opposite slope (74 guns
were here massed together), and inflicted considerable loss,
but being charged in its turn by fresh French cavalry, was
badly cut up. The defeat of the central columns carried
with it the repulse or withdrawal of the flanks, so that this
great attack attained absolutely nothing. Wellington however
found it necessary to order up a brigade from his
reserve, to fill the gap in his front formed by the flight of the
Belgians and the losses in Kempt's and Pack's brigades.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Blucher had been doing his best. The
country between Wavre and the battle-field is formed in
rounded hills and deep hollows, traversed by mere lanes,
and the soil was soft and miry from the heavy rain. At
noon Bulow's leading division reached <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lambert, the
highest point on the road, whence the battle-field was
visible at some four miles' distance: Napoleon within an
hour ascertained that they were Prussians, and too late
recognising his danger, sent off a useless despatch to
summon Grouchy to his aid. He also sent some cavalry
to meet the Prussians, but it was not for at least two hours
more that the latter came into action. The roads naturally
grew worse with use, and the artillery could scarcely be
moved at all. It needed all the energy of hatred which
inspired the whole Prussian army, it needed all the pressure
Blucher in person could put on the soldiers, for the task
to be accomplished. "<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kinder, ihr wollt doch nicht dass
ich wortbr√ºchig werden soll</span>," was the old marshal's often
repeated appeal: and Englishmen ought never to forget it.
At length Bulow was strong enough to push down into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>the valley, and occupy the wood of P√¢ris, whence he could
assail Planchenoit. If he succeeded in this, the French
would be defeated in a most ruinous fashion. Hence Napoleon
not only sent Lobau's corps to face the Prussians, but
himself attended to the new danger.</p>

<p>After the repulse of D'Erlon the main action languished,
only the cannonade and the fighting before Hougomont
continuing, till about four o'clock, when the second main
attack began. Forty squadrons of heavy cavalry charged
up between Hougomont and La Haye Sainte, against
Alten's division, which formed promptly in squares, placed
in a double line chess-board fashion, so that the maximum
of fire<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> could be poured into the charging horsemen. The
guns in front of the English line were necessarily abandoned,
but the French could make no impression on the
squares, and when in confusion were driven off by cavalry
from the English reserves. Again and again the attempt
was renewed with the same result, till even the English
privates saw how hopeless it was. "Here come these fools
again," some of them called out, as a new charge was made.
And indeed it is hard to see why they were made: Wellington's
line was not broken, or even shaken as yet.
Probably the impatience of Ney was to blame, Napoleon
being then at a distance engaged with the Prussians. At
any rate the net result was the destruction of a great part
of the French cavalry, at some cost to Wellington's cavalry,
but not much to his infantry, except from the French guns
which told with deadly effect on the squares in the intervals
of the cavalry charges.</p>

<p>Almost before the first repulse of the French cavalry, a
new infantry attack on the British centre was arranged,
which was to be directed primarily on La Haye Sainte.
Ney it is said asked the emperor for reinforcements, seeing
how badly D'Erlon's corps had been cut up in the first
attack. "Where am I to get them?" replied the emperor,
"<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">voulez-vous que j'en fasse</span>?" In fact not only Lobau's
corps, but a part of the guard, Napoleon's last reserve, had
been already required to keep Blucher at bay, who assailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Planchenoit again and again, though without success.
Nevertheless this attack on Wellington's centre attained a
greater measure of success than any other during the day.
La Haye Sainte was seized after a desperate struggle: and
the French infantry, and still more their artillery, established
there, nearly destroyed the third division on the left
and Kempt's brigade on the right, opening a most dangerous
gap in the English line. Wellington's coolness and judgment
had never failed him for a moment; to demands for
reinforcements he had replied again and again, "It is
impossible, you must hold your ground to the last man,"
and nobly had the English and Germans responded to the
demands made on them. Hence at this dangerous crisis
there were still infantry reserves in rear of the centre, which
Wellington brought up in person to restore the line, simultaneously
drawing in to the centre Chasse's Belgians from
behind the right, and the two light cavalry brigades from
the extreme left, where Blucher's right was now in touch
with Wellington through Smohain, and Ziethen's corps,
coming by the upper road from Wavre, was rapidly approaching.
Napoleon's last reserve, his famous old guard,
must be used to make the last bid for victory. If this had
been directed on the same point, for the sake of the protection
afforded by La Haye Sainte, some further success
might have perhaps been achieved, but by this time nothing
could have saved the French from defeat. Pirch was up
in rear of Bulow, who was again pressing hard on Planchenoit,
and Ziethen inflicted a crushing blow on D'Erlon's
corps, which advanced to attack Wellington's left by way of
supporting the charge of the guard in the centre. The
guard was formed in two columns: the right, somewhat
in advance of the left, came up the slope to the left of La
Haye Sainte, against Maitland's brigade of guards, which
had hitherto had no fighting to do, and was lying down for
shelter from the cannonade, which had been continued to
the last moment over the heads of the advancing infantry.
The crushing fire of the English guards swept away the
head of this column; it fell into confusion in attempting to
deploy, and an advance of Maitland drove it back in
disorder. Maitland had only just time to recover his
position before the left column of the old guard was upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>him. Their defeat however was to come not from him, but
from his right flank. Adam's brigade, originally placed in
rear of the guards, had been brought forward to fill the
place of Byng's brigade, which had been nearly destroyed
in the defence of Hougomont during eight hours of almost
incessant fighting against very superior numbers. The
slope of the ground threw their line somewhat forward at
an angle to Maitland's front; and Colonel Colborne, commanding
the famous 52nd, wheeled his regiment a little
further, so that it took the French guard in flank, stopping
its advance, and throwing it into great disorder. Then was
seen an illustration almost more marked than that at
Albuera, of what line can do against column. Claiborne's
line advancing routed the four battalions of the French
guard; then continuing diagonally across the slope to the
high-road came upon the other part of the guard, which
had been formed up there in columns after its repulse by
Maitland. Wellington, who was on the spot, having just
ordered a general advance of the whole line, told Colborne
to charge them, saying they would not stand. In a few
minutes more the last remnants of the French arrayed
against Wellington were flying in confusion. Bulow about
the same time finally succeeded in seizing Planchenoit,
whence his guns swept the high road that was the sole line
of retreat for the French. Under the merciless pressure of
the Prussian cavalry, which had not yet fought, the whole
French army melted into a mob of fugitives. History
hardly records so complete a dissolution of an organised
army.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> What the French loss was has never been ascertained.
Nearly 15,000 killed and wounded in Wellington's
army, and 7000 in Blucher's, the great majority of them
taken from Bulow's corps, are sufficient evidence of the
severity of the conflict.</p>

<p>Napoleon had played his last stake, and lost it: there is
no use in following his steps as a ruined fugitive. It is
however worth while to sum up the chances of the eventful
day of Waterloo. Early in the morning Napoleon's prospects
were excellent: Wellington's army was slightly inferior to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>his own in numbers, and the Belgian portion of it was not
trustworthy. In consequence of the rain no Prussians
could be on the field at all early. Doubtless the state of
the ground would also have delayed movements of attack
on Wellington's line: but if the battle had begun even at
eight <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> it is scarcely possible that Wellington could have
held on till four, when first the Prussians began to be formidable.
The delay in beginning threw away this advantage.
Secondly Napoleon, as we have seen, miscalculated utterly
about the Prussians: it was he who detached Grouchy with
a force needlessly large for its supposed purpose, and failed
to see in time the necessity of drawing Grouchy to his side.
Thirdly the allied generals carried out tactically the purpose
of co-operation with which they had begun the campaign,
thus ultimately bringing almost double numbers to bear.
It was Wellington's part to hold his ground, it was Blucher's
to come to his assistance. How nobly the old Prussian
redeemed his promise has been shown. Of Wellington it
is told that he was asked to give instructions for the chance
of his falling, a contingency the probability of which may
be estimated from the fact that only one of his staff escaped
untouched. "I have none to give," he said, "my plan is
simply to hold my ground here to the last man." Lastly it
is manifest that all might have failed but for the astonishing
staunchness of the English and German infantry in Wellington's
army. Nothing, in war or in peace, is so trying to
the nerves as passively to await deadly peril, making no
effort to avert it. And never probably in war was greater
strain of this nature put upon troops than fell on Alten's
and Picton's divisions at Waterloo. The guards and Hanoverians
who held Hougomont had more prolonged and
exciting conflict; the heavy cavalry did magnificent service:
to Maitland's brigade, and still more to the 52nd, belongs
the conspicuous glory of having given the last crushing
blow. But after all the chief honour belongs to the English
brigades of Halkett, Kempt and Pack, and to the Germans
who stood by their side.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>THE CRIMEA</small></h2>


<p>Nearly forty years elapsed after Waterloo before another
European war broke out. Peace had been by no means
undisturbed; the revolutions of 1848 in particular occasioned
serious fighting, but there had been no sustained war on a
large scale. England had been entirely exempt; and not a
few persons in England had begun to dream that the age of
peace had begun, while many more thought that England
might and should stand aloof from all European entanglements,
and follow the more profitable pursuits of peace.
There is some reason to think that the latter class involuntarily
helped to bring about war, that the Czar of Russia
would never have adhered to the policy which led to the
Crimean War, unless he had attached undue importance to
their language, and believed that England would not fight.</p>

<p>The period of peace had witnessed great discoveries which
were destined to revolutionise the art of war, as well as the
conditions of peaceful life. Railways had been developed,
fully in England, to a greater or less degree in the other
nations of western and central Europe. Steam navigation
had spread widely, though the majority of trading vessels,
and an even larger proportion of men-of-war, still had sails
only. The telegraph had been invented, but was not very
extensively in use. All these new agencies played some
part in the Crimean War, the telegraph somewhat to the
detriment of the military operations, though their effect was
trifling compared to the influence exerted in the war of 1870
by railways and the field telegraph. Except in one respect,
there had been no changes in the art of war: and this one
exception, the introduction of the rifle, was only beginning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a><br /><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>though it involved potentially the vast extension in the
range and rapidity of fire which has since revolutionised
tactics. The fundamental principle of the rifle, grooving
the gun-barrel so as to produce a rotation of the bullet, was
known in the seventeenth century, if not sooner. The early
forms of rifle far surpassed the musket in accuracy of aim,
and also though in a less degree in range; but the difficulty
of loading them was great, so that they were not suited to
be the ordinary weapon of infantry, though picked men were
armed with them. In 1836 a form of bullet was invented
which would expand on the rifle being fired, and fill the
grooves in the barrel. This conquered the difficulty of
loading, and the rifle was gradually substituted for the
musket; the English infantry sent to the Crimea in 1854
had nearly all received the new weapon, and the French
also, but among the Russians the rifle was still only in the
hands of a few picked men. The range was far less than
what all soldiers are now accustomed to, but the advantage
over the musket was very real. No corresponding advance
had been made with artillery; hence the conditions of a
siege remained the same as during the Peninsular War.</p>

</div>

<p>The Eastern question was not a new one in 1853: it is
not likely to have disappeared from politics for many a year
yet. In one sense it dates from the first conquest by the
Turks of territory in Europe: the decline of a purely military
power was inevitable whenever internal decay wasted the
sources of its strength. Mohammedan conquerors could
not possibly blend with their Christian subjects so as to
form one people, as the Normans for instance did in England.
Moreover, as soon as Russia became a powerful state, it
was natural that she should seek for an outlet to the
Mediterranean: and Russian ambition has been habitually
unscrupulous. If Russia had succeeded in seating herself
at Constantinople, after expelling the Turks from Europe,
the change might or might not have been a gain to the
Christian peoples of south-eastern Europe, but it would have
meant an augmentation of Russian power extremely dangerous
to the rest of Christendom. The other nations of Europe
might have looked on unmoved while any other changes
passed over the Balkan peninsula; they could not afford to
let it fall into the hands of Russia. In face of Russian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>aggression against Turkey, they had no practical option:
they must support, for the present at least, the existing
government of the Sultan, at the cost of prolonging the
domination of a Mohammedan power, intolerant, polygamous,
slave-holding, over Christian subjects whom its creed did
not allow to be treated with common justice.</p>

<p>In the year 1853 the general conditions of Europe were
such as to offer Russia an exceptional opportunity. Austria,
the great power most deeply interested, was under a heavy
debt of gratitude to the Czar, who had recently suppressed
a Hungarian revolt which threatened the very existence of
the Austrian empire; and she had moreover an unimportant
quarrel with the Sultan. The king of Prussia, the power
least interested, was the Czar's brother-in-law, and greatly
under his influence. Napoleon <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> had recently made
himself master of France; and the Czar seems to have
assumed that he was not firm enough on the throne to
venture on war. He ought to have perceived that nothing
would so strengthen the new emperor's hold on France as a
successful war; moreover his uncle's fate and his own
observations had made Napoleon <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> anxious for alliance
with England: if the latter determined on war with Russia,
she was sure to have the co-operation of France. Thus
everything really depended on the temper of England, and
the Russian emperor persuaded himself that from this
quarter he had nothing to fear. A little while before he
had tried to bribe England to acquiescence in his designs,
by suggesting that on the impending decease of the "sick
man," as he called Turkey, he should be very willing to see
England occupy Egypt, and thus secure her most obvious
interest, control of the route to India. English diplomacy
however had been, perhaps unfortunately, so reticent that
the Czar believed England to be under the domination of
the so-called Manchester school, and no longer capable of
going to war to punish unprovoked disturbance of the
general peace of the world.</p>

<p>A quarrel with Turkey was easily raised over the Turkish
treatment of Christian pilgrims at Jerusalem, and the custody
of the Holy Sepulchre there. The Russian demands
amounted to a claim for a full protectorate over all Christian
subjects of the Porte. For the Sultan to grant this would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>have been equivalent to surrendering his independence: he
refused, and Russia occupied the Danubian principalities,
which have since become the kingdom of Roumania. In
consequence of this high-handed proceeding, England and
France, an attempt at mediation having failed, sent their
fleets to the Bosphorus, and Turkey formally declared war
on Russia. In reply to this, the Russian fleet destroyed a
very inferior squadron of Turkish war-vessels in the harbour
of Sinope. This roused public feeling in England, and the
western powers joined in the war. Undecided fighting had
been going on during the winter of 1853-4 along the lower
Danube; and in the spring Russia mustered her armies for
decisive efforts. In May 1854 the Russian troops crossed
the Danube and invested Silistria, which resisted steadily.
England and France sent troops to the mouth of the
Danube, which however were not wanted, for the Czar,
yielding to Austrian menaces, evacuated the principalities.
It might seem that nothing more need have been done:
but so long as Russia retained a powerful fleet in the Black
Sea, protected by the fortified harbour of Sebastopol, it was
obvious that she could at any moment strike at Constantinople.
The western powers accordingly resolved on an
expedition to the Crimea, for the purpose of destroying
this formidable stronghold.</p>

<p>There is no other instance in history of an army composing
over 60,000 men being landed on a hostile coast, in
face of a hostile fleet. No power but England has indeed
ever successfully despatched a complete army<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> by sea, at any
rate since the time of the Crusades; and no other power
could have achieved the invasion of the Crimea. It is true
that the Russian fleet, knowing itself to be far inferior to
the combined English and French squadrons, did in fact
remain sheltered within the defences of Sebastopol: but it
had to be reckoned with, and by the English alone. The
French resources being insufficient to supply adequate
transport, their men-of-war were laden with troops, and
therefore in no condition to fight. Hence the English
squadron had to escort the whole enormous fleet, which
fortunately the Russians did not attempt to disturb. Again,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>the military value of steam navigation was plainly shown on
this, the first occasion of its being employed, even partially.
Every English transport was either a steamer, or was towed
by one, though the French were less fully supplied. Consequently
the expedition was conducted across the Euxine
with speed, and landed exactly where its leaders chose, on
the west shore of the Crimea, some thirty miles north of
Sebastopol. Considerable delay had been caused by the
collection of so vast a fleet of transports, greatly to the
detriment of the health of the armies, which had suffered
from the unwholesome climate of the lower Danube region
in summer, and from an outbreak of cholera, chiefly among
the French. Thus it was not until September 18, 1854,
that the landing was completed. The English army
numbered 26,000 infantry, with 60 guns and about 1000
cavalry: the French had 28,000 infantry and 68 guns, but
had been unable to convey a single squadron of cavalry:
there were also 7000 Turkish infantry. Considering the
known strength of the Russians in cavalry, it seems that the
allies ought to have been better supplied with that arm, even
at the cost of leaving five times the number of infantry
behind. The Russian want of enterprise however prevented
the deficiency being seriously felt.</p>

<p>The allied governments had calculated correctly enough
that the Crimea would not contain large armies; and that
its great distance from the centre of the empire, with the
badness of existing communications, would render it very
difficult for Russia to carry on war there effectively. At
the same time she could not allow Sebastopol to be
destroyed without making every effort to save it&mdash;to do so
would be to acknowledge defeat. The Russian commander,
prince Menschikoff, besides leaving a garrison in the city,
was able to meet the allies with an army very inferior in
infantry (between half and two-thirds of their number) and
fully equal in artillery, but with the advantage of possessing
cavalry nearly four-fold the handful of the English light
brigade. With this force he took post across the main road
leading to Sebastopol, on the south bank of the little river
Alma. The position was very strong by nature, and might
easily have been made stronger by art. For fully two miles
up the stream from its mouth cliffs rise on the south bank,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>in many parts perpendicular, and allowing no access to the
plateau extending thence almost to Sebastopol, save by a
slight and difficult track close to the sea, and by a cleft
three-quarters of a mile up, through which a rough road
ran. Further up the cliffs cease, and the slopes become
gradually more and more gentle, though broken into
buttresses. The main road crosses the Alma more than
three miles from its mouth, and ascends to the plateau
between two of these buttresses. The allies having full
command of the sea, and having men-of-war at hand, it is
obvious that Menschikoff could not occupy the plateau
above the cliffs; but he could with very little labour have
destroyed the two steep and difficult routes, by which alone
the plateau could be scaled. This however he neglected to
do, and when the time came he was unable to oppose the
French troops to whom it fell to ascend them. Nearly all
the Russian artillery was posted on the landward side of the
road, where advantageous ground was available for it to
sweep the slopes in front. A considerable body of infantry
was held in reserve, but the mass of it occupied the crest
of the slopes landward from where the cliffs cease, for about
two miles, the cavalry behind the right of the line.</p>

<p>The country being everywhere open and uncultivated, the
allies were not tied to the road, but advanced on a very
wide front, in columns which could quickly and easily be
changed into line of battle. The French having no cavalry
were on the right, nearest the sea: the English on the left,
with the cavalry watching the front and flank. They had
no definite knowledge of the enemy's proceedings or even
strength, until on the morning of the second day, September
20, they came upon Menschikoff's position behind the
Alma. The order of march necessarily implied that the
French should scale the heights near the sea, while the
English attacked that part of the position which being more
accessible was strongly held. The task was a formidable
one in face of the Russian batteries, some of them of
heavier metal than ordinary field guns. The English
general, Lord Raglan, waited for some time to allow the
French to gain the plateau and so turn the Russian left: if
he had only waited a while longer Menschikoff would
probably have been dislodged without fighting, but Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>Raglan yielded to a request from the French general, and
ordered his line to advance. The light division was on the
left, supported by the first division, consisting of the guards
and a brigade of Highland regiments; the second division
formed the right of the front line. Having given the word
to attack, Lord Raglan with his staff rode forwards, and
under cover of a burning village on the river-bank, reached
a point of observation on the slopes beyond, whence he
could see something of the battle but could issue no further
orders: indeed the generals of division did not know what
had become of him. Under these circumstances the attack
cost the English some unnecessary loss. The first attack,
up a slope raked by a powerful artillery, could hardly have
been made with success in any formation but the familiar
English line, though the space was too narrow to allow the
troops room to deploy fully. Naturally the light division,
which had to face the heaviest batteries, suffered severely;
but they reached the crest, driving back the Russians, who
were formed in solid columns of three or four times their
strength, but who having only a narrow front were overpowered
by the English fire. The Russians hardly fought
with their usual stubbornness, the guns were withdrawn for
fear lest they should be captured, and the victory would
have been gained then and there if the battle had been
properly managed; for the second division was going
through much the same process on the English right, and
the French were by this time making their way on to the
plateau. Unfortunately there was no central control: the
light division had to sustain unsupported a concentrated
fire of infantry and artillery, which drove them at last down
the slope, just before the guards came up behind them.
The Russians soon gave way entirely, and the English
artillery, boldly and skilfully used, inflicted severe losses on
them in their retreat, which neither the cavalry nor the
artillery made any attempt to cover. Close pursuit was not
possible without a large body of cavalry; and the allies
bivouacked on the plateau. The English loss in killed and
wounded amounted to just 2000 men: the French loss of
course was but slight: the Russians admitted a loss of
nearly 6000.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Hamley condemns severely the generalship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>of all parties. The Russian neither made the most of his
position nor held it tenaciously, nor did he make any use at
all of his very superior cavalry. The French had little to
do, and did it somewhat slowly. The English fought admirably,
and exemplified once more the vast superiority of line
over column, if only troops are steady enough to be trusted
in line: but their attacks were ill combined and therefore
costly. All might have been saved, he argues, if the allies,
ignoring the Russian left above the cliffs, had formed line
of battle across their right. Menschikoff could not have
made a counter attack on the right of the allies, for the
descent from the cliffs under fire from the English ships
would have been impossible. He must either have retreated
at once, or have fought in a position where defeat would
drive him into the sea. In fact the allies had much the
same sort of opportunity which Marlborough used with
such overwhelming effect at Ramillies. Neither of the
generals however was a Marlborough; and there was
the natural want of unity in operations conducted by
two independent commanders acting together for the first
time.</p>

<p>The harbour of Sebastopol is an inlet about four miles
long, and from half to three-quarters of a mile wide. The
city with its docks and arsenal is on the south side: and
the ground rises steeply, broken by narrow ravines, to a
high plateau which forms the south-western corner of the
Crimea. On the south side of the peninsula, some eight
miles south-east from Sebastopol, is the small but tolerably
good harbour of Balaclava: and at the corner is the larger
but less sheltered bay of Kamiesch. North of the great
harbour of Sebastopol the ground rises high above the sea-level;
and the highest point was crowned by a large fort,
while other fortifications on both sides of the entrance
defended the harbour against attack from the sea. Menschikoff
immediately after his defeat resolved on his course
of action. Sinking some of the men-of-war in the mouth of
the harbour, so as to make it impossible for the allied fleet
to attempt an entrance, he left an adequate garrison in
Sebastopol, and prepared to march out with the rest of his
army into the open country. By this means he could keep
open communication with Russia, and could use any chance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>that might offer itself of interfering from outside with the
siege operations.</p>

<p>The allies might perhaps have taken the north side of
Sebastopol, with the aid of their fleet to engage the Russian
ships, before the entrance to the harbour was blocked; but
such a step would have brought them practically no nearer
to the capture of the city and arsenal beyond the harbour,
and would have given them no base of operations. From
the nature of the case their base must be the sea, and therefore
they were compelled to adopt the plan, in all respects
the most expedient open to them, of marching past Sebastopol,
seizing Balaclava which became the English port, and
Kamiesch for the French, and beginning a regular siege of
Sebastopol. The Russian communications from the city
northwards were never interrupted, hardly interfered with.
Thus the last great siege of what may be called the Vauban
period of military history, presents the unique spectacle of a
fortress never invested and yet reduced, of the resources
of the defending power being poured into it till they
were exhausted before the superior strength of the enemy.</p>

<p>Two days after the battle of the Alma, the allies moved
southwards. Lord Raglan's resolution of "keeping his
cavalry in a bandbox," so long as they were so few, most
praiseworthy on the battle-field, was inexpedient on the
march; and the Russian general habitually neglected to
use his cavalry. Hence Menschikoff's army quitting Sebastopol,
and the allies moving on Balaclava, narrowly missed
a collision which might have had very serious results. As
it was, Menschikoff had advanced far enough to get out into
the open country unhindered, and the allies occupied their
intended position without a blow. The siege works were
promptly begun, the English, roughly speaking, taking care
of the east side of the city, and the French of the south.
On October 17 a bombardment took place, which it was
hoped might open the way to a decisive assault. The
English fire inflicted enormous damage on the works, but
the magazine in the principal French battery was exploded
by a shell, and the Russians succeeded in silencing the
other French guns, while the ships inflicted far less injury
on the seaward forts than they sustained. No assault could
be made, and the Russian engineer Todleben gave the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>evidence of his remarkable fertility of resource, in the speed
with which he repaired the damage done by the English
cannonade. The Russians naturally suffered greater loss in
men, being more crowded than the besiegers, and obliged
to hold troops in readiness to meet a possible assault. The
well-stored arsenal of Sebastopol saved them from any fear
of being crippled by expenditure of material. The bombardment
was renewed more than once, with much the
same results: it gradually became clear that Sebastopol
would not be taken without a sustained siege.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Russian field army had been gathering in
the neighbourhood of Balaclava, and on October 25, the
anniversary of Agincourt, made an attack on the allied
position there, which led to the most famous feat of arms
of the whole war. From the harbour of Balaclava the
ground rises steeply on the west to the high plateau which
was entirely occupied by the allies. On the east the ground
rises equally steeply, and at the top a line of defence had
been fortified, which formed an adequate protection for
Balaclava itself. Northwards from the harbour a gorge
opened up, past the hamlet of Kadikoi, into a plain, or
rather two strips of plain divided by a low ridge, virtually
surrounded on all sides by hills, which was the scene of the
battle. Along the line of the dividing ridge, close to the
road leading south-east from Sebastopol, a series of earthworks
had been planned, as an outer line of defence, but
they had only been partially made and were very slightly
garrisoned. Lord Raglan had undertaken rather more than
his fair share of the siege operations, and could spare very
few men to hold Balaclava. In fact the garrison under Sir
Colin Campbell only comprised his own regiment, the 93rd
Highlanders, and three battalions of Turks. The English
cavalry division had its camp in the plain above spoken of,
and formed some additional protection, but they obviously
could not man the works. Early in the morning some
25,000 Russians appeared over the hills bounding the
Balaclava plain on the east, and attacked the nearest and
largest of the small redoubts forming the outer line of
defence, which was occupied by a few hundred Turks. No
immediate support was possible: Campbell had not a man
to spare: the cavalry, drawn up at the western end of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>plain, were with reason ordered to await the support of
infantry, which had a long distance to march from before
Sebastopol. The Turks fought obstinately, losing a third of
their number before they were driven out: the Russians
took two more of the line of works, and the Turks, utterly
disheartened at receiving no support, fled in confusion down
to Balaclava, carrying away the rest of their countrymen.
Campbell had only the 93rd to resist an attack which might
well have been made with twenty times his numbers. Kinglake
tells how he rode down the line saying, "Remember
there is no retreat from here, men; you must die where you
stand!" and how the men shouted in reply, "Ay, ay, Sir
Colin, we'll do that!" Fortunately the Russians did not
realise their opportunity, and only made a desultory attack
with a few squadrons of cavalry. Sir Colin did not deign to
form square, according to the established tradition for
infantry receiving a cavalry charge: he simply awaited their
onset in line, two deep, and when the horsemen swerved to
one side and threatened to get round his right flank, contented
himself with wheeling one company to the right, to
form a front in that direction. It was apparently nothing,
but it marks the greatest advance made in warfare since the
invention of gunpowder, the substitution of the rifle for the
musket. The present generation is so used to the later
developments of breechloaders, magazines, machine guns,
which render cavalry useless against infantry unless by
surprise, that it requires an effort to realise the fact that it
is only forty years since Sir Colin Campbell's "thin red
line" dared for the first time to await charging squadrons
in that formation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the main body of Russian cavalry had slowly
advanced up the northern half of the plain, invisible to the
English cavalry from the nature of the ground. An order
had just arrived for eight squadrons of the heavy brigade
to go forwards to Kadikoi and support Campbell. General
Scarlett, who commanded the brigade, was executing this
order, when a solid body of Russian cavalry, between two
and three thousand strong, appeared over the ridge to his
left. Scarlett at the moment was moving through his camp,
where though the tents had been struck the ground was
cumbered by the picketing cords. The Russians, as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>slowly descended the slope, threw out squadrons in line on
each flank. Scarlett as soon as he had room charged with
his leading squadrons, the Scots Greys and half of the
Inniskillings, straight into the solid mass, which made no
attempt to meet him with a counter-charge, though they had
the slope of the ground with them. For a moment the
handful of redcoats seemed to the spectators from the edge
of the Sebastopol plateau to be lost among the overwhelming
numbers of the grey clad enemy, but the second
line came on in support, and the 4th dragoon guards,
arriving last, took the Russians in flank. The unwieldy
mass gave way, and was driven in confusion back across the
ridge, and if only the English light brigade had charged
them, might have been totally defeated. Unfortunately
Lord Cardigan, who commanded the latter, considered
himself bound by his orders to remain strictly on the
defensive. Inexperienced in war, he had no idea that
occasions may arise when a subordinate general should act
on his own responsibility, and he let slip the opportunity.</p>

<p>Two English divisions were by this time approaching,
but were not yet within supporting distance of the cavalry.
Lord Raglan, who was watching everything from the edge
of the plateau, saw that the Russians were preparing to
carry off the guns from the field-works they had captured,
and thought this portended a retreat of their whole force.
Accordingly he sent to Lord Lucan, commanding the
cavalry division, a written order to advance rapidly, and try
to prevent the enemy carrying away the guns. It was a
rash idea at best, the object to be attained being entirely
incommensurate with the cost, and doubly unfortunate,
considering the character of the men on whom it would
devolve to execute it. Much heated controversy arose
afterwards as to the responsibility of those concerned, which
it is unnecessary to enter into.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> The upshot was that Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>Lucan ordered the light brigade to charge the Russian
army, proposing to support them with the heavy brigade,
which had already done one piece of very hard work.</p>

<p>Hardly the great breach at Badajos, hardly the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">herse</i> of
archers against which the French knights staggered through
the mud at Agincourt, formed a more appalling death-trap
than that into which Cardigan's six hundred rode. On the
central ridge to their right were eight Russian guns, on the
hills bounding the plain to the north were fourteen: infantry
were on both ridges, with riflemen pushed down into the
valley below. On each side squadrons of lancers were in
readiness. In front, more than half a mile off, were twelve
guns, before the main body of Russian cavalry, which had
retreated so far after their defeat. Through a storm of shells
and rifle-bullets the light brigade advanced, slowly at first,
and quickening their pace as they went, and actually drove
the gunners away from the Russian batteries at the end of
the "vale of death." Lord Lucan advanced some way in
support with the other brigade, but his men fell fast: and
when the light brigade disappeared into the cloud of smoke
that overhung the Russian guns in front, he halted and
drew back, saying, unless he is misreported, "They have
sacrificed the light brigade: they shall not the heavy if I
can help it." What effect his further advance might have
produced it is hard to say; the audacity of the light brigade
had for the time half paralysed the Russians, and there may
have been just a chance of inflicting a heavy blow, the more
so as at the same time a brilliant charge of some French
cavalry along the line of high ground to the north drove
the Russians away from that quarter. Probably however
nothing could have been achieved to compensate for the
ruin of all our cavalry: the moral effect on the enemy could
not have been intensified. Presently the remnants of the
light brigade were seen emerging from the smoke, and
forcing their way back again, assisted by the clearance of
the northern hills which the French had effected. Out of
a total of 573 they had lost 247 men and 475 horses: one
regiment, the 13th light dragoons, consisted of only ten
mounted troopers at the first muster.</p>

<p>"<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre</span>," is the
famous comment attributed to the French general: and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>no doubt the criticism was valid. At the same time the
capacity to perform actions which transcend even the
legitimate daring of war is a gift rarer, and within limits
far more valuable, than the soundest military judgment.
"The ruin of the light brigade," says Sir E. Hamley, "was
primarily due to Lord Raglan's strange purpose of using
our cavalry alone, and beyond support, for offence against
Liprandi's strong force, strongly posted: and it was the
misinterpretation of the too indistinct orders, sent with that
very questionable intention, which produced the disaster.
And yet we may well hesitate to wish that this step so
obviously false had never been taken, for the desperate
and unfaltering charge made that deep impression on the
imagination of our people which found expression in
Tennyson's verse, and has caused it to be long ago transfigured
in a light where all of error or misfortune is lost, and
nothing is left but what we are enduringly proud of."</p>

<p>The battle of Balaclava left the Russians in a position
which commanded the above-mentioned road leading from
Sebastopol past Balaclava to the south-east, and this
cramped the communications of the English between their
port and the siege works. The allies abandoned, if they
had ever entertained, all thought of fighting a great battle
in order to regain the ground thus lost; but Balaclava was
soon covered with a strong and complete line of defence.
Meanwhile the Russians had been pouring reinforcements
into the Crimea, being well aware that when winter arrived
it would be impossible to do so, and had formed a plan for
attacking the northern extremity of the allied position, where
it approached the upper end of the great harbour. Again
the stress of the conflict fell on the English: in fact the
topographical conditions were such that the English, taking
Balaclava as their harbour, had necessarily to encounter
all attacks from the outside, while the French, taking
Kamiesch, were in contact with the city only.</p>

<p>The plateau surrounding Sebastopol is seamed with deep
ravines running more or less northwards down to the sea,
some of them three or four miles in length. By these
ravines the various portions of the besieging lines were
separated from each other, more completely in proportion
as the works were brought nearer to the city. Thus some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>little time must elapse before any one portion could be
largely reinforced. The Russians hoped, by bringing a
very strong force to bear upon the English troops occupying
the bit of the plateau between the last of these ravines and
the valley of the Tchernaya, to overwhelm them before they
could be adequately supported, and so establish themselves
on the plateau. If they could do this, the allies must fight
a general action with their backs to the sea, that is to say
with the certainty of destruction if they were defeated.
From this necessity the allies were saved by the obstinate
valour of the English infantry, who fought in what is known
as the battle of Inkerman.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>At the beginning of November Prince Menschikoff had
at his disposal more than 100,000 men, exceeding the forces
of the allies in the proportion of at least three to two. He
thus had good reason for hoping to turn the tables on his
enemies; and had his combinations been made with more
skill, he might well have succeeded. His plan was that
nearly 20,000 infantry with a quantity of artillery should
issue from Sebastopol and assail Mount Inkerman, in conjunction
with a somewhat smaller force from outside, which
should cross the Tchernaya by the great bridge at its entrance
into the harbour. At the same time the remainder of the
field army under Gortschakoff was to demonstrate from the
Tchernaya valley against the whole east side of the allied
position; and the ample garrison of Sebastopol was to be
in readiness to assault the siege works if they were denuded
of troops. He forgot that every movement of Gortschakoff
down in the valley could be fully seen from the plateau, and
that therefore demonstrations were futile. A real attack
in all quarters at once might, with his very superior numbers,
have been made without risk: but he was not the man to
depart from conventional methods. Similarly in planning
the actual attack, he was swayed by the conventional, and
usually sound, objection to sending troops into action
divided by an obstacle which prevents all communication.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>Mount Inkerman was obviously to be assailed by ascending
both from the Tchernaya on the east and from the great
ravine on the west, known as the Careenage ravine. The
forces detailed for this purpose would have amply sufficed
to attack simultaneously the tongue of land west of the
Careenage ravine also: but the Russian general was afraid
to divide his troops by this very steep ravine, forgetting
that Sebastopol with its large garrison lay behind, and
committed the far worse error of crowding all his men into
the one attack, where there was not room for half of them.</p>

<p>The tongue of land known as Mount Inkerman is by
no means level. The English second division was camped
just behind a ridge crossing it from east to west, which
formed the position for the English artillery during the
action. In front of this little ridge the ground sinks,
ascending again to a hillock, known as Shell hill, three-quarters
of a mile off, which was the Russian artillery
position. Between them the tongue of land is narrowed
considerably by a ravine on the east side, the incline of
which is gentle enough to allow of the road from Sebastopol
descending it to the Tchernaya. This road ascends to
Mount Inkerman from the Careenage ravine, which may
for practical purposes be deemed to terminate there, about
three-quarters of a mile behind the camp of the second
division. About this point was the camp of the guards'
brigade: opposite it, on the other side of the Careenage
ravine was the camp of the light division. Other English
troops were from two to three miles off: and the nearest
portion of Bosquet's French corps, which was now charged
with the duty of guarding the east face of the plateau
against possible attack from the Tchernaya, was scarcely
nearer. Thus the first stress of the battle fell on the
second division, about 3000 strong, commanded at the
moment by General Pennefather, during the absence
through illness of Sir De Lacy Evans.</p>

<p>Before dawn on November 5, General Soimonoff, issuing
from Sebastopol, led 19,000 infantry and 38 guns up on
to the northern end of Mount Inkerman, and there formed
in order of battle. His heavier guns were posted on Shell
hill, with two lines of infantry, about 10,000 in all, in front
for attack, and the remainder in reserve behind Shell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>hill. As the maximum width of the tongue of land does
not exceed 1400 yards, it may be imagined that the infantry
were in very dense formation, a fact which partly accounts
for the enormous losses which they sustained in the course
of the battle. About seven o'clock the Russians advanced,
their guns opening fire over the heads of the infantry:
Pennefather very wisely pushed his men forwards into the
hollow to support his pickets, occupying the crest in front
of his camp with artillery. The English infantry, formed
as usual in a thin line, and with the advantage of superior
weapons, drove back time after time their far more numerous
assailants. Most part of the light division were naturally
required to occupy their own tongue of land, but General
Buller with two regiments from it was the first to reinforce
Pennefather. One of these regiments rendered the important
service of routing a separate Russian column which
was coming up to the head of the Careenage ravine, and
threatening to take the second division in rear. Gradually
other English troops arrived on the scene, but the conflict
long remained very unequal in point of numbers. The
day was not clear, though dense fog clung only to the
bottoms: hence the Russians, unable to see how little there
was behind the thin red lines which met them so firmly,
imagined that they were encountering masses at least equal
to their own. The inequalities of the ground rendered it
practically impossible to retain regular formation, and this
told against the Russians, both as being much more crowded
together, and also as lacking the power of independent
action which the habit of fighting in line gives. It was
reported at the time that the troops in Sebastopol had been
prepared for battle not only by appeals to their religious
enthusiasm, but also by copious rations of vodki, or, as the
current jest ran, were under the influence of stimulants both
spiritual and spirituous. If there was any truth in this, it
would help to account for the comparative ease with which
the first Russian attacks were routed: when the troops of
General Pauloff, brought across the Tchernaya and up the
eastern slopes, came into action, the fighting was much
more obstinate.</p>

<p>As the English grew stronger on the field, General
Cathcart with the fourth division made a needless attempt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>to push forward along the slope overhanging the Tchernaya,
in which he was killed, and his men suffered heavily.
From the nature of the case, there was nothing to be done
except to hold the ground, and let the Russians exhaust
themselves, as they gradually did. During the latter part
of the battle French troops came up. General Bosquet
had naturally been distracted between his primary duty of
watching the Russians below him in the Tchernaya valley,
and the duty of reinforcing his allies. Soon after the
action began he sent a couple of regiments towards Mount
Inkerman, but an English general, totally misinformed as
to the strength of the Russian attack, stopped them as not
being needed. Later Bosquet learned the true state of the
case, and also saw that the movements in the Tchernaya
valley meant nothing, and he therefore despatched heavy
and welcome reinforcements to Mount Inkerman, the foremost
of which took an important share in the fighting. It
is obvious that if the large Russian force available for the
purpose had attacked Bosquet in earnest, he could not have
spared a man to support the English, who would have been
very hardly pressed. When the Russians finally abandoned
the action despairing of success, though they had lost fully
12,000 men, they had still 9000 in reserve, besides their
broken front lines, while the English had on the field less
than 5000 unwounded men. But for the relief given by
the French, who had been fighting beside them for the
last hour or two, and had borne the weight of the action
to an extent represented by a loss on their part of 900
men, the English would manifestly have been fewer still.
They had lost over 2300 men, or about a third of those
actually engaged; they were in no position to turn the
tables on their opponents, even if prudence had not dictated,
as the French undoubtedly thought, the choice so difficult
in battle of leaving well alone.</p>

<p>Inkerman was not unappropriately christened "the soldiers'
battle." Under the conditions of weather no general
could have efficiently directed any elaborate scheme, and
fortunately none was needed. The shape of the ground
and the relative numbers would have compelled resort to
the simple tactics which in fact were adopted, even if the
air had been perfectly clear. They were in accordance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>with the habitual practice of the British soldier to form line,
and in that formation sustain the attack of columns, and
drive them back in rout when their front has been crushed
by the wider fire of the line. Thus regimental officers
without superior command, even the men uncommanded
when their officers were struck down, were ready to sustain
the fight in the best way. "No other European troops,"
says Sir Edward Hamley, "would at that time have formed
in a front of such extent without very substantial forces
behind them." With an enormous weight of artillery
against them until near the close of the action, with odds
of infantry against them which began at three to one,
and which must have been heavier still for a while when
General Pauloff came on the field, they held their ground
with an audacious obstinacy which it would be difficult to
parallel in European warfare.</p>

<p>The victory of Inkerman marked a decisive point in the
campaign. Foiled in this carefully prepared enterprise, the
Russians henceforth made no attempt to challenge battle
in the open field. They limited themselves to withstanding
as far as possible the advance of the siege operations, which
were carried on under considerable difficulties, arising both
from the nature of the ground and from the skill displayed
by Todleben in making the utmost use of every opportunity.
The approach of winter was however destined to
enforce, not a cessation of hostilities, but the prosecution
of them in a slow and uneventful fashion. Reinforcements
could no longer reach the Crimea, except at a cost prohibitory
even to the vast resources in men of the Russian
empire. And though the allies, having their communications
by sea, were not liable to the same exhaustion, yet
a disaster befel them soon after Inkerman which reduced
them for the time practically to the defensive. On November
14 a furious storm burst on the allied camps, followed
by much rain and snow. The tents were blown down, and
the whole country converted into a wilderness of mud. At
the same time many vessels laden with stores were wrecked.
For many weeks after this disaster, the sufferings of the
English army were intense. The fundamental cause was
want of forage: without it the horses died, and supplies
could only be conveyed from Balaclava to the camp by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>soldiers, already as hard worked in the trenches as they
could bear. Food was never actually wanting, but hardly
any fuel was to be procured; the soldiers were never dry,
and often ate their food raw. Naturally under such conditions
they sickened and died in thousands. The French,
having shorter distance between their harbour and camp,
and a tolerable transport service already organised, in
which the English were deficient, and having also a smaller
part of the siege works to maintain, suffered materially less.
Things improved slowly, but the siege was protracted
indefinitely; in fact it became a contest of endurance
between the rival powers, in which the command of the sea
ensured ultimate victory to the allies.</p>

<p>Early in the new year the French, whose army had now
been largely reinforced, took in hand an additional portion
of the siege works, thus making for the first time a fairly
equal partition of labour with the English.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Instead however
of taking over the left portion of the English works,
which adjoined his own, the French general preferred to
undertake the new operations which had long been intended
against the east face of the city. Here however the
ever active Todleben seized and fortified, just in the nick
of time, a knoll some way in advance of the Malakoff
redoubt, the main defence of this side of Sebastopol. This
new fortification, known as the Mamelon, was so situated
as to prevent the English trenches at the south corner of
the city being pushed forwards. Consequently the main
work of the siege concentrated itself on the new French
attack.</p>

<p>Political reasons operated to cause delay, which may
be fairly said to be one of the results of divided control.
The death of the Czar Nicholas made no difference,
for his successor could not but continue the defence.
But the opinion of Napoleon <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>, that the capture of
Sebastopol was only feasible if it was completely invested,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>which meant the detaching of a force to cope with the
Russian field army, was persistently pressed. The English
government, like the generals on the spot, thought differently;
but the emperor must be held responsible for at
least part of the waste of time. Conflicts, equivalent in the
losses sustained to many pitched battles, occurred again
and again. A bombardment of ten days in April, which
would have been followed by an assault if the whole siege
had been directed by a single enterprising general, cost the
Russians over 6000 men. The artillery employed on both
sides far exceeded, both in number of guns and in weight
of metal, anything that had ever before been seen in a
siege. The material progress during forty years of peace
was visible in many ways. Steamers brought the contents
of the English and French arsenals: the English made
a railway from Balaclava up to the camps: a telegraph
cable put the Crimea into communication with the western
countries, which greatly accelerated the supply of whatever
was wanted, though it enabled Napoleon <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> to worry the
army incessantly with his military ideas. Marshal Pelissier,
however, who took Canrobert's place in the spring, was
equal to his position, and in concert with Lord Raglan
carried on the siege upon the principles already determined.
On June 7, after another terrific bombardment, the
French stormed the Mamelon, though not without a serious
struggle. On the 18th another attack was made which
ended in failure. The day had been chosen in the hope
that a victory won by English and French in common
might supersede the bitterness of Waterloo: but whatever
chance of success existed beforehand was wasted by Pelissier's
suddenly determining to assault without waiting for
a preliminary cannonade. The result was that the French
were repulsed from the Malakoff with heavy loss, the
English from the Redan, the chief Russian work at the
south-eastern corner of the city, with at least equal loss
relatively to the numbers engaged, the only success being
the capture of a small work in front of the English left.</p>

<p>In spite of this failure, in spite of the death of Lord
Raglan which occurred a few days later, the siege went
steadily on. The resources of Russia were gradually becoming
exhausted. Returns compiled about the date of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>the Czar's death gave the total cost of the war to Russia
at 240,000 men: since that date more than 80,000 had
fallen in the Crimea. An ill-conceived attempt to raise the
siege by attacking the eastern side of the allies' position
from the Tchernaya valley failed disastrously in August.
Prince Gortschakoff, now commanding in the Crimea, felt
that the end was approaching, and took measures to prepare
for the evacuation of Sebastopol, but changed his
mind and awaited the final assault. On September 8 the
end came: the French trenches had now been brought
quite close up to the Malakoff tower, and Pelissier, carefully
noting the exact point and moment at which an
assault could best be delivered, stormed the great work.
A simultaneous attack by the English on the Redan was
a necessary part of the plan: the soil in front being solid
rock, the assailants had to advance for some distance over
open ground, and suffered badly. The capture of the
Malakoff was however decisive. During the following night
the Russians abandoned Sebastopol, or rather its ruins: for
they completed, in blowing up their magazines and forts,
the destruction wrought by the bombardments. The siege
of Sebastopol takes rank in history not as the most momentous&mdash;in
that respect it falls far below the Athenian
siege of Syracuse&mdash;or the most protracted, but as that in
which the greatest resources were employed on both sides.
Success fell, as might be expected, to the side which
represented the greatest advance in material civilisation.</p>

<p>The war nominally lasted for several months longer:
the allied armies occupied the Sebastopol peninsula during
the winter, and small operations were directed against other
points of Russian territory. Substantially however the fall
of Sebastopol was decisive; the destruction of the great
arsenal and fortress was a heavy blow to Russian power in
the Black Sea, and the retention of it had been made so
definitely a point of honour by Russia that its capture was
a formal symbol of defeat. With the spring of 1856 terms
of peace were agreed on, which included the prohibiting
any ships of war to sail on the waters of the Black Sea. At
one moment it seemed as if France would have acceded
to terms which required from Russia practically no sacrifice;
but Napoleon <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> yielded to remonstrance from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>England, coupled with the assurance that England was now
able, and quite prepared, to carry on the war alone.</p>

<p>The history of England is full of evidence that there is
almost no limit to the power which an industrial nation,
having command of the sea, can bring gradually to bear
upon a warlike enterprise, always assuming that she has the
necessary resolution. And no more striking evidence is to
be found than from comparing the state of the English
army in the Crimea in December 1854 and in December
1855, especially if we bear in mind the expenditure in men
and material during the year. Whether anything of the
same kind could happen again, whether in another war
time would be available for utilising resources which must
in a sense be latent till war begins, whether other nations
have gained on England in the race of material progress,
whether England would again exhibit the national tenacity
displayed in the Peninsula and in the Crimea, are
questions which every lover of peace will desire to see
remaining, as they are at present, matters of speculation.</p>

<h3>INTERMEDIATE NOTE<br />

<small>INFERIOR RACES</small></h3>


<p>It is more than probable that Wellington's Indian experience
stood him in good stead when in the Peninsula he had to face
the task of converting the untrained Portuguese into good
troops. Discipline is essentially the same, whatever the race or
character of the men to be subjected to it. They have to learn
prompt obedience to orders, the habit of relying implicitly on
their officers for military guidance, familiarity with the idea that
duty must be done first and personal safety left to take care of
itself, coolness and presence of mind in encountering danger,
even unexpectedly. All this the Portuguese had to learn, but in
other respects they were like enough to his English troops,
already disciplined to his hand. They were Europeans and
Christians, that is to say they recognised more or less the same
moral code: they were patriotic, striving with foreign assistance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>to deliver their homes from the foreign conqueror. They had
motives for responding to the call made on them which are
intelligible, and cogent, to any European. The native troops
that Wellington had learned to employ in India were like them
in one important point, their being called on to trust and follow
a foreign leader; they were like them also, as the event proved,
in capacity to profit by training; but in ideas and habits they
were totally different.</p>

<p>The British conquest of India is one of the most astonishing,
as well as important, things in modern history: and the wonder
of it consists mainly in the fact that the English from the first
were successful not only in getting their subjects to fight for
them, but in transforming them, for military purposes, almost
into Englishmen. Men of the most varied types were from
time to time brought under the spell. Hindoos with a peculiar
and very ancient civilisation of their own, the higher castes
regarding themselves as socially and morally the salt of the
earth, the lower castes accustomed to permanent and almost
degrading inferiority; Mahommedans who had once been conquerors
and deemed themselves the born superiors of their
former slaves; fierce hill-men very low down in the scale of
civilisation; strangest of all, the Sikhs with their national and
religious enthusiasm still young,&mdash;all alike became the zealous
soldiers of their rulers from over the sea. Nor was this all: the
sepoys imbibed the military qualities of the men who fought
beside them, including the superb tenacity which makes the
British soldier always hard to beat.</p>

<p>The English battles in India were nearly all fought against
odds, occasionally enormous; and in every case, except in some
of the battles during the Mutiny, the bulk of the army consisted
of native troops. What is the explanation of this phenomenon,
unique in history? One main cause clearly was, to quote Colonel
Malleson's<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> words: "the trusting and faithful nature, the impressionable
character, the passionate appreciation of great
qualities, which formed alike the strength and the weakness of
those races;" but this description hardly applies to all the
multifarious races of India, though doubtless it does to many,
and pre-eminently to the people of Bengal, where practically
the British dominion was founded. Half of the explanation
must be looked for on the other side. Unless the natives of
India had been capable of receiving the impression, obviously
none could have been made: but the Englishmen who laid the
foundation of our Indian empire possessed the requisite qualities
for creating it. They made their followers understand that when
an Englishman said a thing he meant it, and this in two senses.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>If he made a statement he believed it to be true; also, and
more important, if he gave a promise or declared a purpose, he
would fulfil it. Further they taught the natives to understand
that when a thing was undertaken, it must be done; difficulties
must be vanquished, odds, no matter how great, must be encountered,
if such things came into the day's work. The coolness
with which they assumed the certainty of success naturally
went a great way towards achieving it, and was all-powerful in
convincing the natives, ignorant, but by no means stupid, that
the English possessed an inexhaustible reserve of strength and
resource. Then the English treated their native soldiers well,
looked after them more steadily and intelligently than any
Indian princes would have cared or known how to do, and
taught them to feel that they were invincible. The very strangeness
of the Englishman's motives and principles of action made
them all the more impressive to men who saw that they were
successful. And the fact that the sepoys were assumed by their
officers to be capable of great things went far to make them so.
Never give in, never mind odds; these were the maxims on
which the men of whom Clive is but the most conspicuous,
habitually acted; and the results were that these became the
accepted rules of conduct for Englishmen in India, and that the
native soldiers of whatever race learned to rely implicitly on
their officers.</p>

<p>Scores, hundreds of times in the last century and a half,
in matters great and small, English officers have acted on
these principles as a matter of course; and equally as a
matter of course their native soldiers have done under English
leadership what they never would have dreamed of doing if left
to themselves. Courage, most of the races which furnished
sepoys possessed in abundance; and that courage they placed
at the disposal of the foreigners in whom they recognised
fertility of resource, power of combination, so far above their
own level, that they seemed to belong to a superior order of
beings. Nor can there be any doubt that the fact of their being
so regarded helped to raise the English above their natural
level.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> They must live up to their position, both to the traditions
of the service and to the idea entertained of them. When they
cease to do this, the hold of England on India will be precarious.
Whether they are tending to do so may be judged from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>history of any and every little war, such for instance as the
Kanjut expedition in 1891, the most notable feature of which
was the storming of Thol, and which is fully and picturesquely
described in Mr. E. F. Knight's book, <cite>Where Three Empires
Meet</cite>. Even more characteristic of the needs, and the achievements,
of British rule in India, is a narrative of an incident on
a very small scale, done in the way of everyday business, which
is given in a tolerably recent newspaper (the <cite>Spectator</cite> of April
23, 1892) from a letter of the chief actor.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant G. F. MacMunn, <abbr title="Royal Artillery">R.A.</abbr>, had been ordered to
march with fourteen men, of whom, fortunately for him, twelve
were Goorkhas, to convey some stores, principally rum, from
Myitchina to Sadon, a small fortified post in Burmah, a distance
of about fifty miles. The road was considered perfectly safe,
and about twenty-five miles were passed in tranquillity, when
the young lieutenant&mdash;he cannot be above twenty-two&mdash;received
information which showed that some rebels of the Kachyen
tribe intended to bar his path. This meant that he must either
retreat, or force his way along a rough road, continually crossed
by streams, and lined with jungle on each side, through a hostile
force which might number hundreds, and did number sixty at
least, armed with muskets, and sufficiently instructed in the
military art to build stockades both of timber and stone. Lieutenant
MacMunn, who had probably never heard a gun fired in
anger in his life, seems not to have doubted for a moment about
his duty. The people in Sadon, he thought, would want the
rum, and he pushed on, to find the enemy holding a ford where
the water was up to his shoulders. He plunged in with three
Goorkhas, and forded the eighty yards of water, 'getting volleyed
at awfully,' but was left unwounded, and 'rushed' one side of
the stockade, and then, bringing over the rest of his men, rushed
the remaining works. The Kachyens fled, but four miles in
advance towards Sadon halted again, constructed another
stockade, and filled the jungle on each side of the road with
musketeers, who poured in, as the Goorkhas advanced, a deadly
fire. The Jemadar was shot through the lungs, a Goorkha hit
in the foot, and Lieutenant MacMunn wounded in the wrist;
but he went down into the jungle with two men only, the remainder
forming a rearguard, and carried the stockade, the
Kachyens firing futile volleys, and the Englishman and his
comrades, as he writes in school-boy slang, 'giving them beans.'
Sadon was now visible, and encouraged by the sight, Lieutenant
MacMunn pressed on; but the Kachyens were not tired of the
fight, and had erected another stockade, this time of stone,
across the road, with a ditch five feet deep by ten feet broad in
front of it, a proof in itself of their considerable numbers and
skill. The lieutenant asked 'the boys' if they would 'follow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>straight,' and they being Goorkhas, half-mad with fighting, and
understanding by this time quite clearly what manner of lad
was leading them, 'yelled' that they would, and did. Into and
out of the ditch, and up to the stockade, and again the Kachyens
fled, only to turn once more, and&mdash;but we must let Lieutenant
MacMunn tell the rest of his own story. 'It took us half-an-hour
to repair the road and pull down the stockade; and on
and on, wondering where our friends were.' (The garrison of
Sadon knew nothing of the advancing party or its danger.)
'One mile on they again fired at us from the jungle; but the
road was clear, and we hurried on down the hill, where we had
to cross a river bridged by our sappers. On the way down they
banged away at us, and near the river they had stuck in any
amount of pointed spikes in the road, and while we pulled these
up they fired again and again, and we volleyed in return. We
then hurried down to the bridge; to our dismay it was destroyed,
so we had to cross the river by wading lower down, and very
deep it was. It was quite dark, and took us quite half-an-hour
to get every one across, and then the road was blocked with
spikes and trees, and the Kachins fired continually. At last we
got to Sadon village, half-a-mile below the fort which our
fellows had made. In the village from every house and corner
they fired. My horse was shot in the hind-leg, the bullet going
through the muscle, and a driver was hit too. The Goorkha
ponies broke loose and galloped about, the mules went in every
direction, and the Goorkhas cursed and blazed away, and still
no sign from our friends, and I began to fear the fort had
been taken. I put the wounded driver on a pony, and we
hurried on, collecting what ponies and mules we could. In ten
minutes more we saw the fort in the darkness ahead, and I
started off a ringing cheer, followed by my men; bugles rang
out, and they cheered in reply, and in another minute we were
inside. I was surrounded by men on all sides, patting me on
the back, holding me up, giving me water, asking questions.'"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>INDIA<br />

PART I.&mdash;CONQUEST</small></h2>


<p>The history of the foundation of the English empire in
India is full of paradoxes. The East India Company had
no purpose beyond trade: they had been allowed to form
settlements at various places, and like other landowners
had a few armed men to protect them against possible
violence; but they did not dream even of asserting their independence
of the native princes. It was the French, not the
English, who won the first victory against great odds over a
native army, and so disclosed the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arcanum imperii</i>, the secret
that European discipline would prevail against almost any
numbers, and that native soldiers, trained in the European
method and fighting alongside of European comrades, could
be made almost equally effective. The restless ambition of
Dupleix, striving to establish French dominion in southern
India, led him to attack the English of Madras, as hereditary
enemies at home as well as possible rivals in India. The
English were driven to war in self-defence, and they found
in Clive a leader who was nearly Dupleix's equal as a statesman,
and was also, what Dupleix was not, a born general.
Down to 1751 it had been supposed in India that the
English could not fight: they had certainly shown no inclination
for war. Clive's defence at Arcot, followed by his
victory in the field over a very superior force commanded
by a Frenchman, transferred to his countrymen that moral
and military preponderance which Dupleix had gained for
the French. No better illustration can be found of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>principle that the boldest course is generally the safest, than
Clive's victory at Cauveripak.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 398px;"><a id="i_b_294"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_294.jpg" width="398" height="600" alt="Map XVIII: Outline Map of India." />
</div>

<p>The first step was thus gained involuntarily, as a consequence
of French aggression: the second and more important
step was the result of an unprovoked attack on
Calcutta. In 1756 a spoilt boy became Nawab of Bengal,
and at once proceeded to make war on the English settlements,
which had virtually no means of resistance. On his
capture of Calcutta, followed by the well-known catastrophe
of the Black Hole, the Madras government sent all the force
that could possibly be spared, under the command of Clive,
to attempt to regain what had been lost. Clive's landing
was followed by the easy recovery of Calcutta and by other
successes, which terrified the Nawab into restoring all that
the English had ever held in Bengal. Clive however had
not forgotten Dupleix. The Seven Years' War had just
broken out; it was more than probable that the French,
whose influence was still paramount in the Deccan, would
ally themselves with the Nawab, and so enable him to
re-conquer Calcutta. Clive in fact was beginning to discern
dimly, what we after the event can see plainly enough, the
end to which affairs in India were tending. Given the
political conditions, the Mogul empire utterly weak, and its
nominal subordinates fiercely hostile to each other; given
also the enormous preponderance conferred by European
discipline; the time was approaching when some European
nation would become supremely influential, the chief power
in India, if not actually dominant. Moreover the only
possible candidates for supremacy in India were France and
England: and in view of the rivalry between them in America
as well as in Europe, no postponement of the inevitable
struggle in India was to be looked for. Neither side saw
clearly the greatness of the stake for which they were
contending, but each felt instinctively that there could be no
security while the rival power retained a real hold on any
part of India. The game was won for England on the field
of Plassy by the political and military genius of Robert Clive.</p>

<p>The miserable Surajah Dowlah was no match for Clive in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>the cabinet, any more than in the field. Afraid of his
neighbours, especially of the Mahrattas, he was distracted
between desire to conciliate English support and dread of
English power. The French settlement of Chandernagore
was, like Calcutta, under the nominal suzerainty of the
Nawab, and therefore though France and England were at
war, Clive had no right to attack it without the Nawab's permission.
The refusal was a grievance of which Clive made
the most; he seized Chandernagore, and defied the native
army that was marching to protect it. Surajah Dowlah had
dreamed, in one of his vacillations towards a leaning on
English support, of crushing with their aid the great nobles
whose power was a danger to him. Hence some of them
were ready to side with the English against him, and Clive
ultimately made a regular treaty with one of them, Meer
Jaffier, who was to be made Nawab, on payment of a large
sum, as soon as Surajah Dowlah had with his assistance
been overthrown. When Clive however found himself
within reach of the Nawab's army, Meer Jaffier was still on
openly friendly terms with his master, and in command of a
division of the army. Clive had only general assurances
that Meer Jaffier meant to keep his engagement with the
English, which might or might not be sincere.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the case put any middle course
really out of the question. Though various expedients were
suggested, he must choose between retreat and attacking with
3000 men, of whom less than one-third were English, the
Nawab's army of 50,000 men, on the chance of Meer
Jaffier coming over to his side. While the choice was yet
open, while a river still separated the two armies, Clive
called his officers together. Councils of war proverbially do
not fight, and this was no exception. The majority, with
whom Clive himself voted, advised against immediate
action. The minority, led by Eyre Coote, who afterwards
won the victory of Porto Novo that broke Hyder Ali's
power, declared for advancing. When the council was over,
Clive, with whom as commander the final decision necessarily
rested, went apart under a clump of trees, and there
took the resolution on which the fate of India hung. Next
morning his little army crossed the river, and by nightfall
was face to face with the enemy; they bivouacked in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>mango grove north of the village of Plassy, with the river
close to them on the west, and the intrenchments which
covered the Nawab's camp about a mile off to the north.</p>

<p>Early next morning (June 23, 1757) the Nawab's army
moved out and took order for battle. On the right, half-a-mile
north of the grove which sheltered Clive, and close to
the river, were posted some guns manned by Frenchmen,
behind which were massed the flower of the Nawab's troops,
commanded by his one thoroughly trustworthy general
Meer Mudin. The rest of the army extended thence in a
long curve, formed with horse, foot, and artillery closely
massed together, so far that its extremity almost surrounded
Clive. The left portion, that nearest to the English, was
commanded by the traitor Meer Jaffier, who still hesitated
to take any decisive step. Clive formed his little army in
order of battle, north of the grove, his one English regiment,
the 39th,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> in the centre, with his few small guns and his
sepoys on each side. Cavalry he had none, while the
enemy had some 15,000, besides twelve times his number
of infantry, and five times his number of guns, mostly of
heavier calibre. The enemy opened a cannonade, but did
not attempt to come to close quarters: they had no need
to do so, for their converging artillery fire would have
sufficed to destroy the force exposed to it. Clive was in a
trap, he could not advance on the French guns without
ruinous loss, and exposing himself to being surrounded.
Retreat was out of the question: all he could do was to
take shelter in the mango grove, which was surrounded by
banks, and await events, resolving at any rate to attack the
Nawab at night. Then occurred an incident resembling
that which preceded the battle of Crecy. A heavy storm
wetted the powder of the Nawab's artillery, and reduced
its fire to insignificance. Meer Mudin, thinking that the
English guns were in equally evil case, boldly advanced
with his cavalry to assail the position. But Clive's guns,
which had been covered from the rain, received him with a
discharge of grape, which drove the cavalry back in rout.
Meer Mudin himself was killed, and with him died the
Nawab's chance of victory. Timid and incapable, surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
by men who were either traitors or cowards, the
Nawab gave the order to withdraw within the intrenchments,
and soon fled from the field. Meer Jaffier so far disobeyed
orders, as not to withdraw within the lines; but to the last
he never mustered up courage to make his treason complete
and side openly with the English. Clive now saw that his
opportunity was come; advancing boldly, he drove back
the artillery which was manned by Frenchmen, in spite of
their determined resistance. The enemy's army was still
intact, but they were practically without leaders, the Nawab
having fled, and some at least of the chief officers being
desirous to see Clive successful. In a disorderly fashion
they issued once more from their intrenched position, but
Clive gave them no rest: pushing on from point to point he
drove them from their camp, winning one of the most
decisive and far-reaching victories recorded in history, at a
cost of less than a hundred killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The battle of Plassy virtually gave the East India Company
Bengal, Behar, and Orissa. Many other wars had to
be waged, many battles won by skill and daring which
equalled, if they did not surpass, Clive's exploits, before the
English rule was so firmly established that it could give
peace and security to its subjects. But those victories were
facilitated by the profound impression produced on the
native mind by Plassy. It was no unmeaning instinct which
interpreted the famous prophecy about the Company's <i lang="hi" xml:lang="hi">raj</i>
lasting a hundred years only, to mean that it would be
overthrown when a century had elapsed since the battle of
Plassy.</p>

<p>Twenty years later Hyder Ali, a Mahommedan adventurer
who had usurped the throne of Mysore, made an attempt to
oust the English from southern India. It was not until
after a long and doubtful struggle that he was overcome:
indeed he himself died before the conflict was over, and the
comparative incompetence of his son contributed greatly to
the triumph of the English. Decade by decade it became
clearer that whether the East India Company liked it or not,
English power must extend itself further and further, under
penalty of perishing altogether. The original strictly commercial
basis of the Company had not been forgotten, but
new policy had been forced upon it, partly by the necessity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>of its position, partly by the intervention of Parliament.
English officials in India no longer possessed the old opportunities
for enriching themselves, which some of them had
used with shameless rapacity, some with admirable disinterestedness.
Good government, peace, security, were at
any rate the avowed objects of the Indian administration,
which had been more or less centralised ever since 1773 by
the appointment of a governor-general. When in the first
years of the nineteenth century one more native power
attempted to expel the English, the supreme authority for
this final conflict was in the hands of perhaps the ablest
and most far-sighted statesman, whose name figures on the
distinguished list of governors-general of India.</p>

<p>Colonel Meadows Taylor's remarkable tale <cite>Tara</cite> is probably
less widely known than it deserves. Those who have read it,
know what a fascinating picture it presents of the condition
of life in India, at the epoch when the Mahratta power was
founded. In the decline of the Mogul empire, during the
latter part of the seventeenth century, a new Hindoo power
was gradually built up, the original seat of which was in the
difficult mountain country of the western Ghauts. Sivaji the
founder appealed alike to the religious zeal and to the race
feeling of the Hindoos, as against their alien Mahommedan
rulers, without nominally repudiating allegiance to the
emperor; the Mahratta power grew and spread, till it became
supreme all over central India. Even in Bengal the raids
of the Mahratta horsemen were a real danger: the first
fortification of Calcutta, some years before Plassy, bears the
name of the Mahratta Ditch. Late in the eighteenth century
the Mahratta confederacy had fallen into somewhat the
same condition politically as the Mogul empire. Their
titular head, the Peishwa, was no more really supreme over
the other Mahratta princes than the emperor at Delhi had
been over the rulers of the Deccan and Bengal. About the
time at which Mysore was finally passing into English
hands, the ablest of the secondary Mahratta princes had
gone near to making himself master of all India, outside the
British sphere. He dominated the puppet emperor at
Delhi; he had troops trained and officered by Europeans,
besides the splendid cavalry which had always been the
main strength of the Mahrattas. He was rapidly acquiring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>preponderant influence over the Peishwa and the other
Mahratta states, and dreaming of using his power to expel
foreigners from India, when his death broke up the whole
fabric.</p>

<p>The new Sindia<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> did not inherit his father's abilities,
but he pursued in a clumsy and hesitating way the
same policy. The Peishwa broke loose from his influence,
fomented a quarrel between him and Holkar, and then,
frightened at the storm he had raised, appealed for protection
to the English. Lord Wellesley seized the opportunity:
by the treaty of Bassein the Peishwa put himself
into leading-strings. Sindia tried in vain to revive his
father's schemes for a complete union of the Mahratta states
against the British power. The Peishwa was bound, Holkar
jealous; only the rajah of Berar could be induced to join
him in war. The two princes however commanded between
them a very large army, comprising some 10,000 infantry
trained and largely officered by Europeans, a large amount
of excellent artillery, cavalry estimated at fully 40,000, and
a mass of irregular infantry besides. Against this force
Lord Wellesley could bring into the field, after providing
for other needs, nearly 17,000 men, including the cavalry of
his dependent allies the Peishwa and the rajah of Mysore.
This army was commanded by his brother Arthur Wellesley,
but in view of the many possibilities of the campaign, it was
divided into two nearly equal parts, General Stevenson
commanding the smaller. Poona, the Peishwa's capital,
had to be guarded, the safety of provision trains ensured
(for the Mahrattas had wasted the country), and the enemy
prevented from entering the Deccan, it being known that
they were trying to induce the Nizam to join them.
Wellesley's capture of Ahmednugur rendered Poona safe,
and he then moved towards Sindia, who on hearing the news
instantly set out towards the Deccan. With his enormous
mass of quick-moving cavalry, Sindia, having even a small
start, could have reached Hyderabad if he had dared;
but he lost heart on finding that Wellesley was marching
after him, and turned north-eastwards, managing to avoid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>fighting until he had concentrated the whole of his army.
Wellesley and Stevenson met and concerted a plan, by
which they should follow different routes, a proceeding
apparently rendered necessary by the narrowness of defiles
to be traversed, and fall on the enemy simultaneously on
August 24.</p>

<p>Early however on the 23rd Wellesley, when he had just
completed an early morning march, was informed that
the enemy was encamped within a few miles, but was preparing
to move off. As this would frustrate the plan of
attack concerted with Stevenson, Wellesley must either let
them escape or attack at once with his own force only. He
had but 4500 trained troops, including two English infantry
regiments, the 74th and 78th, and the 19th light dragoons,
the rest being sepoys: there were also nearly 5000 cavalry
belonging to Mysore and to the Peishwa, but he had good
reason to believe that the latter at least would desert him
if trusted. On coming in sight of the enemy, Wellesley
found them drawn up on the opposite side of the river
Kaitna, the infantry massed on the left near the village of
Assye, the cavalry on the right. He saw at once that in the
confined space they occupied (the river, with a little tributary
flowing into it, forms a sort of horse-shoe) the enemy could
not possibly bring their enormous superiority in cavalry to
bear. The point<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> where the Kaitna could be crossed, was
on the enemy's left flank, within gun-shot of Assye, so that
the troops were obliged to ford the river and form their line
of battle under fire. The Mahrattas meanwhile had had
time to make something of a fresh formation facing the
British line, the left still resting on Assye, and a second line,
formed of troops for which there was no room between the
rivers, at an angle to the first. A competent enemy would
have used some of his enormous masses of cavalry to charge
Wellesley's forces while fording the river, but Sindia was
not very competent, and his ally proved himself a coward.
Better men than either, both before and after Assye, were
apparently paralysed by the coolness with which the English
commanders did the most audacious things: it was as if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>they either could not believe their eyes, or took for granted
that there must be some reserve out of sight to support such
an advance. Wellesley's plan was to move his right slowly
forward on Assye, while his left pushed on rapidly to force
back the enemy's right; if this were done, the whole of the
enemy's army would be jammed together upon the little
tributary of the Kaitna, unable to fight effectively. The
74th however, on the right, were too eager and advanced
too fast; the overwhelming artillery fire from Assye killed
the cattle of the few guns that accompanied them, and
caused slaughter enough to check the infantry. Sindia
ordered forward his cavalry to charge the disordered line,
but Wellesley was too quick for him; bringing up the 19th
light dragoons and the Madras cavalry he ordered them
to charge at full speed against the advancing Mahrattas.
Nothing could resist the shock: the Mahratta horsemen
were driven behind their infantry, and the 74th had time to
rally. Meanwhile Wellesley had been pushing forward his
left, and by the time the village of Assye was carried, his
left had swept round, and the whole of the enemy's masses
were driven at the point of the bayonet back upon the little
tributary of the Kaitna, which however was fordable. As
the infantry showed signs of re-forming beyond the stream,
Wellesley followed them up with his cavalry, and effectually
dispersed all but the troops trained in European fashion,
which however retreated without attempting to renew the
action. The Mahratta horse had still to be dealt with:
they had been sharply checked once, but their numbers
had suffered little. Wellesley's cavalry succeeded, though
not without a severe struggle, in driving them off the field.
The victory was for the time complete, though the loss was
heavy in proportion to the numbers engaged, the English
regiments in particular suffering greatly.</p>

<p>It required a month's more campaigning, the capture of two
or three fortresses, and another battle at Argaum, to complete
the subjugation of the region south of the Vindhya hills.
Simultaneously General Lake had been engaged in a campaign
far away to the northwards, overthrowing Sindia's
power in the basin of the Ganges. Having stormed the
extremely strong fortress of Aligurh, he had defeated near
Delhi a Mahratta army consisting largely of trained troops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>and commanded by a Frenchman, and had restored the
blind Mogul emperor, who had long been a prisoner of
Sindia, to his nominal throne. Two months after Assye,
Lake destroyed on the hard-fought field of Laswaree the
last army with which Sindia could keep the field. He and
his ally practically submitted themselves to the English.
Holkar tried his fortune later, with the same result.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> If he
had combined with Sindia in 1803 there might have been
a better chance for the Mahrattas. The victory of Assye,
which must on the whole be regarded as the decisive one
of the Mahratta war, made the East India Company virtual
masters of India. The Mogul emperor was their pensioner,
the rulers of Oude, Mysore, the Deccan, their willing dependents.
The Mahrattas gave more trouble before they
fully submitted, and there was fighting in various other
quarters at one time or another during the generation which
followed Assye; but these wars were comparatively unimportant.
Substantially it may be said that in the Mahratta
war of 1803 the political genius of Lord Wellesley, aided
by the military skill of his brother, completed the British
conquest of India as far as the Sutlej.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>INDIA<br />

PART II.&mdash;SUPREMACY</small></h2>


<p>Three times, after the East India Company had become
supreme in India, its dominion was exposed to serious
danger of overthrow. The Afghan war, dictated by mistaken
policy, and badly carried out, led to the greatest
disaster in Anglo-Indian history, though it was redeemed by
subsequent successes. The Sikh military power, built up
by an able ruler, and disciplined by European officers, went
very near to defeating British armies in pitched battles.
The mutiny of the Bengal sepoys turned against England
the main instrument of her previous conquests.</p>

<p>In the course of a long reign Runjeet Sing had become
by far the most powerful Indian prince since Hyder Ali.
The Khalsa, as the Sikh commonwealth was styled, was full
of zeal for its creed, a reformed Hindooism. The race was
hardy and vigorous, and Runjeet Sing, taking into his service
many French and other adventurers, had given his army a
discipline and cohesion never before approached by any
oriental troops. He had conquered several provinces from
the Afghans, though not uniformly successful against them,
and by carefully respecting the prejudices of his people had
won complete ascendancy at home. Though naturally he
looked with no favour on the growth of the British power, he
had the wisdom to discern its vast strength, and sedulously
cultivated friendly relations with it, which the Calcutta
government was very willing to maintain. One of the subsidiary
purposes of the ill-advised Afghan war was to assist
Runjeet Sing in increasing his dominions at the expense of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>the Afghan monarchy. The real determining motive was
however the same which led to the equally ill-judged Afghan
war of 1878-9, dread of the advance of Russia in central Asia.</p>

<p>In 1837 Persia, largely under Russian influence, tried to
wrest Herat from the Afghan monarch, Dost Mahommed,
but the attempt failed, chiefly through the energy of Eldred
Pottinger. The Afghans, fanatical Mahommedans, and
bitterly hostile to foreigners, only asked to be let alone.
Their country is very mountainous, and difficult of access,
much of it barren, and the outlying parts occupied by lawless
predatory tribes. With a little assistance from India,
they would have afforded then, as later, a most effectual
barrier against a Russian advance. Dost Mahommed
would have welcomed an English alliance, chiefly to protect
him against Persia. Lord Auckland however, the governor-general,
persuaded himself that Dost Mahommed was not
to be trusted, and determined to replace him by a pretender
who had, as the event showed, no partisans in Afghanistan.
Armies were sent to invade the country by more than one
route, as from the nature of the case was inevitable, and
occupied it without serious resistance. Then the difficulties
began. Shah Sujah, the British puppet, had no capacity
and could establish no power. Almost every imaginable
blunder was committed by the English authorities at Cabul,
both civil and military: the envoys were murdered, the
army was to all intents and purposes placed in the hands of
the revolted Afghans to destroy at their pleasure. The
government of India was slow to perceive the absolute
necessity of retrieving by vigorous measures our lost credit,
and of avenging those who had been treacherously slaughtered.
Lord Ellenborough, who succeeded Lord Auckland,
was less incompetent to deal with the crisis, though his
policy was by no means faultless. In 1842 Afghanistan
was again occupied by armies, this time well and boldly led;
and then the puppet was withdrawn, and Dost Mahommed
resumed his throne. The net result of the whole war was to
inspire in the Afghans a feeling of active dislike towards the
English, which had hardly existed before, and to diminish
the elements of order and civilisation, and therefore the
chances of resisting Russia in case of need, in a state
always barbarous and a prey to violence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>What might have happened if Runjeet Sing had lived to
hear of the disaster at Cabul, whether his fidelity to the
English alliance would have been proof against the temptation
to strike for Sikh supremacy in India, it is not pleasant
to conjecture. He however died when the first invasion of
Afghanistan was progressing, and his death was followed by
virtual anarchy in the Punjab. Rulers and ministers in
rapid succession rose to power by violence or intrigue, and
were deposed and murdered by similar means. Every
revolution made the Sikh army more and more powerful in
the state, more and more conscious of its own power. The
soldiers were admirably brave, and capable of enduring
enormous fatigue, nor had their discipline been impaired by
their political preponderance, with its consequent high pay
and license of violence. Man for man they were superior to
any other natives of India, and little, if at all, inferior to
English soldiers. Strong in religious zeal, they believed it
to be their mission to expel the foreigners, and establish,
throughout northern India at least, a purified Hindoo
empire. The Sikhs were well provided with artillery, on
which they placed their main reliance, and trained in all the
methods of European warfare: though slow to attack, they
defended intrenchments with extraordinary determination.
Altogether they were an enemy such as the East India
Company had never yet encountered. Fortunately for
England, they had no really skilful generals, and they were,
at any rate in the first war, led by men who were only
anxious for their own personal advantage: from the soldiery
they had practically bought their offices, and might be overthrown
by them at any moment. At the best these chiefs
calculated that a war with the English, if unsuccessful,
would bring them under less exacting masters, if successful,
might lead to indefinite possibilities. Their conduct, on
more than one occasion, warrants the belief that they
deliberately sought to destroy their own men.</p>

<p>Sir H. Hardinge, who succeeded Lord Ellenborough as
governor-general, was an experienced and capable soldier:
he saw that a Sikh war was probably inevitable, and brought
troops up within easy distance of the frontier, while avoiding
such a concentration as would provoke immediate attack.
On December 11, 1845, the Sikhs crossed the river Sutlej,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>the virtual frontier: Sir John Littler, who commanded the
only British force in the immediate neighbourhood, boldly
marched out of Ferozepore and offered battle, though they
had five times his number. His confident attitude impressed
the Sikhs; their nominal commander-in-chief, who
desired to commit them as deeply as possible, represented to
them that it would be much more glorious to encounter and
defeat the governor-general, and they followed the insidious
advice. In a few days the English commander-in-chief,
with a portion of the army that was concentrating, drew
near. Misinformed as to his numbers, and urged on by
leaders who desired their destruction, the Sikhs did not
march with their whole force to meet him at Moodkee, but
sent a detachment of barely his strength, all arms included,
and very weak in the most important, infantry. Sir Hugh
Gough showed on all occasions impatience of everything
but direct attack in front. Forming his infantry in line he
advanced, regardless of the Sikh artillery in their centre:
his cavalry by a brilliant charge broke the superior Sikh
horse which threatened his flank, and the Sikh infantry,
greatly outnumbered, were inevitably forced back with the
loss of most of their guns, though they never were routed.
This experience of the quality of his enemies ought to have
taught Sir Hugh Gough wisdom: had it done so, the unnecessary
loss of several hundred men might not have been
too dear a price to pay. Three days later (December 21,
1845) the available forces were concentrated, and moved to
attack the Sikh army, which had entrenched itself to await
him. Their position was, to use the words of Gough's own
despatch, "a parallelogram of about a mile in length and
half a mile in breadth, including within its area the strong
village of Ferozeshah&mdash;the shorter sides looking towards the
Sutlej and Moodkee, and the longer towards Ferozepore
and the open country." The governor-general, who had
joined the army, intimated his readiness to serve under
Gough. Whether the battle would have been less rashly
fought if he had commanded in chief, cannot be known;
certainly Gough, whose courage was magnificent, but who
had no idea of using skill to save resort to sheer force,
brought the army to the verge of overwhelming disaster.</p>

<p>The short December day was nearly over before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>troops were ready to begin the attack. The plan of the
battle was of the simplest. Littler, on the left, was to assail
the west face of the Sikh position; Wallace on his right, the
south-west corner and part of the south face, Gilbert on the
right, the south-east. Between Gilbert and Wallace was
massed nearly all the artillery, of which Gough in his impatience
made very little use. Against Littler the Sikhs
had, as it happened, their heaviest artillery, as well as overwhelming
infantry; and his attack was decisively repulsed.
Wallace carried the intrenchments opposite him, but remained
exposed to the fire of the enemy, who had only
been driven back. Gilbert succeeded to about the same
extent, but as darkness came on retired a few hundred
yards, and there remained, ready to renew the action with
daylight. The reserves were brought up just before dark;
the 3rd dragoons charged a battery and silenced it, and then
swept through the Sikh camp, dealing destruction as they
passed, but suffering heavily. Sir Harry Smith's division of
infantry forced its way into the heart of the Sikh position,
but being attacked in the dead of night was obliged to
retire some distance. So qualified a success was practically
a defeat; Gough was no doubt fully determined to renew
the struggle, but it is hard to see why further efforts should
have been decisively successful, if the Sikhs had been
properly commanded. They however had really no general:
the nominal commander, Tej Sing, was watching Ferozepore
with 10,000 men. The chief minister, who was with
the main army, desired for his own sake the destruction of
the soldiery whom he could not control. Hence when day
dawned, the Sikhs had no coherence or definite purpose,
and allowed themselves to be driven from Ferozeshah
almost without resistance. Tej Sing and his division were
by this time near enough to have restored the action, and
perhaps to have won it, for the English ammunition was
exhausted. But the traitor contented himself with a mere
demonstration, and then fled, leaving his troops to take care
of themselves.</p>

<p>The moral effects of this battle were considerable: it
showed that the English were not invincible. Though they
had been ultimately victorious, it was because the Sikhs
abandoned the contest, not by their own prowess. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>origin and growth of beliefs is always difficult to trace,
nowhere more so than in India; but it is at least credible
that the mutiny of 1857 may have been encouraged by the
discovery that the success of the white men was not inevitably
decreed by fate. Gough thought it necessary to wait
for several weeks, while heavy guns were brought up, before
resuming active operations in person. Meanwhile the
Sikhs, feeling themselves more or less in the ascendant,
crossed the Sutlej with a considerable force, and Sir Harry
Smith was sent to protect Loodiana. At Aliwal (Jan. 28,
1846) he completely routed his enemies and drove them
back over the Sutlej. This victory led Golab Sing, who
was playing a very important part in Sikh affairs, and was
aiming at his own aggrandisement, whether in hostility to
the English power or by agreement with them, to open
negotiations, which elicited from the governor-general the
intimation that if the Sikh army were disbanded, he would
leave the Sikh monarchy standing. The army however was
its own master, and bent on continuing the war for the
predominance of their faith.</p>

<p>When at length Gough's artillery arrived, the Sikhs were
occupying a position at Sobraon, analogous to that at
Ferozeshah, but weaker in that the intrenchments were
in parts very badly constructed, and disadvantageous in that
the Sutlej flowed behind it, though adequately bridged.
On Feb. 10, 1846, Gough moved before daylight to the
attack, and by the help of a fog had his artillery in position
and his troops formed in front of the enemy before they
were seen. Again his impatience would not wait for the
cannonade to do its work effectually: the delay of seven
weeks since Ferozeshah was rendered virtually useless.
The right being the weakest part of the enemy's intrenchments,
the plan was that the British left should deliver the
real attack, while feints were made by the centre and right.
The Sikhs however reinforced their right so strongly that
the assailants could make scarcely any impression. Gough
seeing this, ordered the infantry of his centre and right to
attack in earnest. They suffered heavily, and recoiled for a
moment, but they had relieved the left, and gradually the
whole British line pressed the Sikhs back. Tej Sing again
set the example of flight, and in crossing the bridge broke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>the centre of it. Whether this was a deliberate piece of
treachery or not, it was fatal to the Sikh army, which, fighting
desperately to the last, was cut to pieces or driven into
the Sutlej. This victory was decisive: the Sikhs submitted
to terms which, while leaving the child Dhuleep Sing nominal
Maharajah, made the British resident virtual ruler of the
Punjab, from which moreover the eastern provinces were
ceded to the East India Company. Cashmere also, which
was to be ceded in lieu of a large war indemnity, was sold
to Golab Sing, who paid the sum which the Sikh government
had promised&mdash;a transaction indefensible in principle,
and mistaken in policy.</p>

<p>Peace seemed to be so well assured in the Punjab that
Sir Henry Lawrence, the first resident at Lahore, went to
England for his health without misgivings. His successor,
a man of less penetration, was profoundly convinced that
no trouble was to be apprehended; yet all the time the
Sikh army and nation were cherishing the purpose of
making another effort for independence, if not supremacy in
India. The mischief began at Mooltan, an important and
well fortified town in the extreme south of the Punjab,
where in the spring of 1848 two English officers were
murdered by the soldiery. Whether Moolraj, the governor
of Mooltan, instigated the deed, is doubtful; but he cast in
his lot with the perpetrators. It is suggested that this rising
was part of a wide scheme, and intended to compel the
English government to undertake a difficult siege at the
worst period of the year. The new governor-general counted
it the proper business of the Sikh government to put down
what was, formally at least, a rebellion against them. The
old commander-in-chief, Lord Gough, doubted the feasibility
of reducing Mooltan in summer. Their hand was however
forced by <abbr title="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Edwardes, political officer of a neighbouring
district, who raised some native levies, and marched on
Mooltan. He was presently joined by a small force under
General Whish, and by another of Sikhs despatched from
Lahore. The latter presently went over to Moolraj, whereupon
General Whish perforce abandoned the siege till he
could be reinforced, but remained in the neighbourhood.
Successive revolts and defections making it plain that the
Sikhs as a nation were resolved on war, Lord Gough collected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
an army, and crossed the Sutlej in November. He
was short of numbers until Mooltan should fall, and was
intended only to observe the Sikh army and prevent its
attempting any offensive movement. His inveterate habit,
however, of rushing at the enemy, regardless of every consideration
except the hope of inflicting an immediate blow,
showed itself immediately. The Sikh commander, who
had no great skill, was of his own accord quitting a strong
position at Ramnugur. A reasonable man, who was not
completely master of the situation, would have been glad to
let him thus throw away an advantage. Gough must needs
attack him with infantry, and lost several hundred men in
compelling the enemy to do what he was already doing
without compulsion. A month later, when changing circumstances
rendered it expedient that active operations
should be attempted without waiting any longer for Whish,
he indulged the same propensity in a most wanton manner.</p>

<p>The Sikh army were posted near Chillianwalla, on the river
Jhelum, their front covered by a thick belt of jungle. It
was suggested to Lord Gough that he should move so as to
place his right obliquely across the enemy's left flank; if
this were done, the enemy's line could be enfiladed by
artillery, the left driven in on the centre, and the whole
army routed.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The jungle in front of the Sikhs, which
prevented them from making a forward movement, greatly
facilitated this man&oelig;uvre: if Gough had adhered to his plan,
they could only have escaped defeat by retreating. It was
afternoon (Jan. 13, 1849) before the English army came
within reach of the Sikhs, and the intention was to halt for
the night, and engage next morning. The Sikh general,
however, either merely to do what mischief he could to the
enemy, or, as has been suggested, with the deliberate intention
of provoking Gough to attack, pushed forward some
guns and opened fire, to which the English artillery replied.
Neither party could really see the other for the intervening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>jungle, and the comparatively innocuous cannonade might
have been ignored. Lord Gough's fighting temper was
roused, and he did precisely what the enemy could have
desired: he ordered his infantry to make a direct attack.
The dense jungle, in one part nearly a mile in depth,
naturally broke up the order of the troops. On the left one
brigade of Sir Colin Campbell's division reached the hostile
guns, but was overpowered and driven back. The other
brigade, under Campbell in person, found itself almost surrounded;
for the Sikhs being considerably superior in
number, their right extended beyond the British line, and
part of it was able to close upon Campbell's flank and rear,
though the rest was kept in check by the cavalry on the
extreme British left: he however obstinately maintained his
ground. The infantry of the right wing under Gilbert was
somewhat more successful, thanks in some measure at least
to the brilliant services rendered by Dawes' troop of horse
artillery. The cavalry however of the right wing were badly
defeated. Lord Gough ordered forward his last reserve to
fill the gap between Campbell and Gilbert: and after a
severe struggle the infantry line succeeded in forcing the
Sikhs back, and establishing themselves beyond the jungle.
By this time the cavalry of the right wing had re-formed and
had been reinforced from the left; there was daylight yet
left for a charge, which, pushed home upon the Sikhs, who
were already giving way and disordered by hard fighting,
might perhaps have been decisive. Gough however did not
see, or would not use, the opportunity, and went forward
in person to the infantry. They were in a sense victorious,
but the enemy was not routed, and might resume the
action. There was neither food nor water within reach.
It was deemed necessary to withdraw from the hard-won
field to Chillianwalla, abandoning the wounded and the
captured guns, that could not be removed in the dark. To
do this was virtually to acknowledge defeat, though fortunately
the Sikhs had lost so severely that no evil consequences
followed. A braver soldier than Gough never lived; but
few battles are recorded in which the general showed himself
more incompetent than at Chillianwalla, none in which
the blunders of the commander were better redeemed by
the courage of the soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>More than a month of comparative inaction followed.
The Sikh army was largely reinforced, and used every effort
to tempt Gough to another battle before he could be joined
by the troops now set free by the fall of Mooltan. Gough
however either had at length learned prudence, or yielded to
the counsels of others, and steadily refused to fight until it
suited him. On February 21 took place the final battle of
the campaign, in front of the town of Gujerat. The Sikhs
occupied a position of no strength, for the two streams on
their right and left were at that season easily passable anywhere.
They might easily have found a better position in
the immediate neighbourhood: but nothing could have
saved them from defeat, unless Lord Gough had reverted to
his favourite tactics. The British army was very superior in
artillery; probably no army of anything like equal numbers
had ever before been so strong in this arm, whether for the
weight of metal, the number of guns, or the precision of fire.
The Sikhs understood artillery well, and trusted to it greatly;
and they would be naturally all the more impressed by
finding the preponderance against them.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The plan of
attack was simply that after the Sikh artillery had been
silenced, the infantry should advance, and that Sir Colin
Campbell on the left should turn the right of the Sikhs, this
being the flank by which their line of retreat could be most
effectually threatened. This programme was in the main
carried out, though Gough's impatience ordered the infantry
forward a little too soon. But for this hardly any of the
infantry need have been seriously engaged. The Sikhs
resisted with their usual bravery, but were ultimately forced
to abandon the field; and their retreat was converted into
a rout by the English cavalry and horse artillery. A few
days later the remains of the army laid down their arms, and
the Sikh nation submitted. After due deliberation the
British government determined to annex the Punjab. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>administration of the new province was entrusted to the
best men in India, headed first by Henry and then by John
Lawrence, with the result that eight years later, in the
terrible strain of the Mutiny, the Punjab was a main source
of strength. The Sikhs, who had been the most dangerous
enemies of British rule in India, won over by good government,
and largely by the personal influence of the Lawrences,
became our most faithful and valuable supporters.</p>

<p>The history of the Indian Mutiny must be written either
at length, or in the briefest possible way. In the whole
region of the Ganges, between lower Bengal and the Punjab,
the sepoys with few exceptions revolted, and murdered in
most cases their English officers. The English, isolated in
small bodies, defended themselves as best they could, with
the obstinacy of their race, and the determination of men
who felt that surrender, while certainly disgraceful and
injurious to the general cause, gave no certainty of rescue
for their own lives. In most important places, as for
instance in Lucknow, they held their ground: in a few, as
in Delhi, the rebels gained complete possession. The
people generally, alive to the advantages of British rule in
ensuring peace and good government, but unable to understand
their masters, and especially their holding the balance
even between Hindoos and Mahommedans, remained on the
whole passive. The native princes, whose territory, roughly
speaking, bounded on the south the disturbed region,
remained generally faithful to England, notably the great
Mahratta princes, Holkar and Sindia, though the adopted
son of the last Peishwa, whose succession the British government
had refused to acknowledge, was naturally a bitter
enemy. Had they all made common cause with the
insurgents it is hard to see how the empire could have been
saved, even though the Punjab needed no troops, and the
Madras and Bombay sepoys remained on the whole true to
their colours. Gradually as more and more British soldiers
became available, the revolt was crushed out, though not
without great exertion and much time.</p>

<p>The point on which the largest amount of attention was
concentrated was Lucknow, the capital of Oude. The
annexation, a measure rendered absolutely necessary by the
scandalous oppression of the king, had been too recent for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>even Sir Henry Lawrence to have won over the population,
who furnished a very large proportion of the rebel sepoys.
Hence the difficulty of forcing the way to the capital was
exceptionally great, and it had to be done three times. The
original garrison was but small, the 32nd regiment and
about 500 native soldiers who remained faithful. There
were many English women and children shut up with them.
They had no real defences, inadequate supplies, and almost
no servants, and it was the hottest season. After Sir Henry
Lawrence was killed, Colonel Inglis of the 32nd held the
command, and proved himself fully capable of making the
most of his very meagre resources. At the outset it was
expected that they could hold out for about a fortnight: it
was eighty-seven days before Havelock was able to force
his way to Lucknow, and then it was only to reinforce, not
to rescue. The heroic endurance of those long weeks cannot
be described in sober prose: no English reader can wish to
see it attempted, with Tennyson's noble poem in his memory.
Havelock had had long and severe fighting in the neighbourhood
of Cawnpore, before he could even begin to advance
towards Lucknow. At the last moment General Outram
was sent to supersede him, the government apparently
thinking, most unreasonably, that it was Havelock's fault
that more had not been achieved. But Outram, the 'Bayard
of India,' would not rob Havelock of the credit: in his first
and only general order issued on joining the little army, he
announced that he waived his superior rank, and would
accompany the force in his civil capacity as the new chief
commissioner of Oude. Havelock and Outram forced their
way into Lucknow on September 28, when Outram of course
assumed the chief authority. His first idea was to withdraw,
but he found that transport could not be provided for the
women and children and the large number of sick and
wounded. He therefore resolved to await relief from Sir
Colin Campbell, which could not be very long in coming.
Campbell however was hampered by many difficulties before
he could leave Cawnpore: and it was not till November 17
that he fought his way into Lucknow. The storming of the
Secunderbagh, a fortified palace in the outskirts of the city,
and of the Shah Nujeef, a mosque near it, are among the
most sensational feats authentically recorded. They could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>not be better told than in the admirable narrative of Mr.
Forbes Mitchell, then a sergeant in the 93rd Highlanders,
which played a conspicuous part in the relief. This time
the garrison was withdrawn, for Campbell had not men
enough, if he occupied Lucknow in force, for the critical
operations which awaited him around Cawnpore: but the
gallant Havelock died, worn out, before the retreat began.
Outram remained in a fortified position at the Alumbagh
not far from Lucknow: and after disposing of other duties
Campbell returned to make a final end of the Lucknow
rebels. This time the forces available were large, the operations
could be conducted in a methodical way without
undue waste of life, and the work was done effectually.</p>

<p>More important in its moral effect, more remarkable as an
instance both of political and military audacity, was the
reconquest of Delhi. The imperial city had but a small
force of sepoys stationed in it, when the mutiny broke out
at Meerut, forty miles off. Many of the mutineers hastened
to Delhi, flying, it would seem, from the expected vengeance
of the English troops at Meerut, who however were detained
inactive by the hopeless incapacity of their general. The
Delhi sepoys rose at the news, and slaughtered all the
English in the city: those who lived outside fled as best
they could. Lieutenant Willoughby, in charge of the great
magazine, defended it for some time, aided by eight men
only; and then blew it up, and a thousand rebels with it.
The ancient capital, with all its resources, was for the time
lost: and the mutineers proclaimed the restoration of the
Mogul emperor, who, old and blind, resided in the palace,
though this did not mean his assumption of any authority.
The supreme importance of recovering Delhi was obvious,
but it was not till three weeks after the outbreak that
General Barnard, who had become commander-in-chief by
the death of General Anson, marched for Delhi, ordering
all that could be spared from Meerut to join him. Wilson
with the Meerut force had to fight his way, and after his
junction with Barnard a considerable battle had to be
fought; but on June 8 the army established itself in the
old garrison cantonments, on a long ridge which looks down
on the city from the west and north-west. It was obviously
far too small to besiege Delhi in any real sense. It could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>furnish visible evidence that England had not abandoned
the idea of reconquest, but it could do no more without
reinforcements and a siege train, unless by a direct and
immediate assault. Some of the ardent spirits in the army
strongly urged General Barnard to hazard an assault; and
if he had done so, he might very possibly have succeeded;
for the odds against him were not much greater than when
Delhi was taken three months later, and the moral effect of
prompt audacity is always great, especially in India. He
however thought the consequences of failure too disastrous
to be risked without a greater chance of success. Consequently
Delhi became more and more the focus of the
mutiny, to which streamed all rebels not already in organised
bodies: and its fall was a greater material blow to their
cause. This however can hardly be set against the value of
an early proof that the British could and would re-establish
their power. It requires an extraordinary man to realise
that the risk of failure is no greater because the result of
failure will be ruinous, and to run the risk with a full
determination not to fail. Had Nicholson, or Havelock,
or Edwardes, been in command before Delhi, the risk
would have been faced. Barnard however was not an
extraordinary man: the early opportunity once let slip,
nothing could be done but hold on. The rebels, daily
gaining in number and possessing unlimited stores of
ammunition, made repeated attacks. The British army,
though invariably successful in their encounters, and slowly
gaining more and more ground, could not in any sense be
said to besiege the city: they were not far from being
themselves beleaguered. Moreover no help could come
except from one quarter. The whole mass of the revolted
territory lay between Delhi and Calcutta. The means of
conquering Delhi must be furnished, if at all, from the
Punjab.</p>

<p>England has never been better served than by the men
who at the crisis of the mutiny governed the Punjab and
adjoining provinces. The country was full of disaffected
regiments, but they were nearly all disarmed without
mischief: where material force to compel obedience was
lacking, the calm assumption of irresistible authority answered
nearly as well. Nowhere did the mutineers obtain the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>superiority, though a certain number made off towards the
rebel ranks at Delhi. After a little observation of the
temper of the Sikh population, Sir John Lawrence took the
bold step of enlisting them by thousands, to take the place
of the Mahommedan and Hindoo mutineers. The Sikhs
had found the new government just: they saw its attitude
of perfect confidence in its own strength, and they served it
as devotedly as they had followed Runjeet Sing. Not only
did Lawrence win the Sikhs to remain peaceful themselves,
and keep down the elements of disorder on the borders,
thus setting free the English regiments; he was able also
to contribute thousands of Sikh troops of all arms to the
recovery of Delhi. The delay increased his difficulties, for
it weakened the belief in English invincibility. Regiments
mutinied that had hitherto remained quiet: the wild tribes
of the frontier, the non-Sikh parts of the population, were
in a ferment. Lawrence however held firmly to his conviction
that Delhi was the paramount consideration: he
even despatched to Delhi the "movable column" which had
been organised in the first days of the mutiny to meet
emergencies. This force was commanded by John Nicholson,
possibly the greatest of the many heroes of Anglo-Indian
story, and he became the soul of the besieging army.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the siege train early in September all
felt that the crisis was come. Archdale Wilson, who had
succeeded to the command on Barnard's death, was still
doubtful of success, but he yielded with a good grace to
bolder counsels. From the nature of the case nothing
could be done but to batter those portions of the walls
which were within reach from the English position, and then
assault. After a few days' bombardment breaches had been
made in the northern walls, one in the water-bastion close
to the north-eastern angle, one near the Cashmere gate,
which were deemed sufficient. On September 14 the
attack was made in four columns; it was not supposed that
the whole of the great city, swarming with desperate men,
could be conquered at once, but if a firm footing were once
gained within the walls, the rest of the work might be done
gradually. One column under Jones was to storm the
water-bastion, another under Nicholson, the breach near
the Cashmere gate: a third under Campbell was to blow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>in the Cashmere gate, while Reid with the fourth was to
take the suburbs on the western side of the city, and make for
the Lahore gate, in the middle of the western face. The
two first columns advanced first, and both were successful
in making good their footing within the walls. While
Nicholson was fighting his way house by house onwards,
Jones turning to the right made his way along the walls.
It would seem as if in the confusion all parties had lost their
bearings, or else Jones should apparently have taken the
Cashmere gate in flank, and saved the obvious risk of
blowing it in. Ultimately, Jones found himself on the west
side of the city, near the Lahore gate, but did not attempt
to seize it, his rendezvous with Nicholson being at the
Cabul gate further north, to which he retired. This waste
of a chance was not of as much importance as it might
otherwise have been, for Reid's attack failed for want of
guns, with which the enemy were well provided. He himself
was struck down, and all his men could do was to hold
firmly the extreme end of the previous position. When
Nicholson at length was able to force his way to the Cabul
gate, and meet Jones, the enemy was in great strength
there, and it would perhaps have been better policy to be
content with what had been gained on that day. Nicholson
however pushed forward towards the Lahore gate, and was
mortally wounded while attempting the impossible. Meanwhile
the Cashmere gate had been blown in: two engineer
officers, with three sergeants and a bugler, were told off for
this most difficult of military duties, for it requires not
merely courage to face almost certain death, but perfect
coolness to deal with the unexpected. Both the officers
were badly wounded, two of the sergeants were killed, the
third barely escaped being crushed in the explosion, but the
powder was fired, and the gate blown to pieces. Campbell
had no difficulty in entering the city, but he also failed to
penetrate far. The day of the storm closed with no more
success than to have taken possession of the northern edge
of the city, and this at a cost of 1200 men, besides Nicholson,
who was worth all the rest. The first blow however
was really decisive: the rest of the city had to be conquered
piecemeal, but the heart of the resistance was gone. The
old Mogul emperor, who had for three months been the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>puppet of the mutineers, was taken prisoner. His sons
were shot without trial by Hodson, commander of a famous
regiment of irregular cavalry, a deed for which Hodson, who
acted on his own responsibility, has been very strongly condemned
and as warmly defended. Terrible severity was at
first employed in punishing the rebels at Delhi, for which
there was the excuse that nowhere had helpless women and
children been so brutally murdered. There were some who
even wished to destroy the city, as an example. Thanks
to Sir John Lawrence, however, humane counsels prevailed,
and the peaceful inhabitants of Delhi, who had been
grievously ill-treated by the mutineers, returned to their
homes.</p>

<p>The effect of the fall of Delhi was not as great as it
would have been had Barnard stormed the place in June:
but it put an end to the strain in the Punjab, and followed
as it soon was by the relief of Lucknow, marked the definite
turn of the tide. From that time onwards it was visible to
all India that the English rule would be restored. The
mutineers still fought on, but in fury and despair rather
than expecting success. Great as was the danger at the
outset, narrow as was the margin between the English in
India and total destruction, the mutiny ended in strengthening
our hold in the country, besides furnishing the most
vivid testimony in all history to the maxim that nothing is
impossible, while life remains, to those who have courage
and coolness.</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES:</h2>
<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> There was doubtless learning in Northumbria, but it was altogether
monastic, and limited to that one kingdom.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The famous story of Harold having sworn unconsciously on all the
relics in Normandy, is told by the Norman writers in many different
forms, more or less inconsistent with each other, and some of them
demonstrably incorrect; and it is impossible to discover the truth.
That William accused Harold of perjury all over Europe, and that no
answer was attempted, is evidence that something of the sort had
happened. As Professor Freeman points out, the absolute silence of
all the English chroniclers implies that they did not know how to meet
the accusation. Harold must have taken some such oath, under some
form of coercion, and so have given his enemy an advantage; but
obviously it would have been a greater crime to keep such an oath than
to break it. Obviously too, on any version of the story that is not self-refuted,
William's conduct was far more dishonourable than Harold's.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Professor Freeman's great History of the Norman Conquest contains
a very minute discussion of every point of detail, and a narrative
framed by laboriously piecing together the statements which on careful
comparison he deems most correct. Much of this is very valuable,
though there is at least one important point in which his account
cannot be right. Much of it is more or less wasted labour, because
it involves giving a precise meaning to expressions in the authorities
which were probably used loosely. The main outlines are clear
enough, the details are at least partially conjectural, and inferences
based on physical facts are a safer guide, so far as they go, than interpretations
of the inconsistent and perhaps unmeaning language of
monkish writers.
</p>
<p>
There is also the Bayeux Tapestry, which has been reproduced by
Mr. Collingwood Bruce, and which for costume and arms is invaluable:
but from the nature of the case it is a very poor guide in
determining the tactics of the battle. To rely on it for such purposes,
as Professor Freeman and others do, seems to me as unreasonable as
to deduce a military history of the battle of Agincourt from Shakespeare's
<cite>Henry <abbr title="the Fifth">V.</abbr></cite>, as put on the stage.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> A vehement controversy has raged since Professor Freeman's
death regarding the accuracy of his narrative, the point most strenuously
disputed being his statement that Harold's front was protected
by a solid wooden barrier. It is maintained in opposition that there
was nothing but the wall of interlaced shields familiar to both Saxons
and Danes. Without entering into the controversy, I content myself
with saying that while the weight of testimony seems to be in favour
of some kind of obstacle having been erected, I am satisfied, for the
reasons given in the text, that there cannot have been anything like the
massive structure described by Professor Freeman.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> It must have been later in reality; since sunrise, the whole Norman
army had marched seven miles, had halted, and had then been arrayed
in order of battle, and this on October 14. Moreover, such a battle
could not have lasted nine hours, and it certainly ended at dark.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> This suggestion is not based on any direct statement, but it seems
to be the only way in which the archers could have aimed effectually.
If they had been behind the horsemen, shooting over their heads, the
arrows would have been as likely to strike Normans as Saxons.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Harold's tomb was shown at Waltham down to the date of the
dissolution of the abbey. There is no positive information on the point,
but there seems no reason for rejecting the explanation that William
afterwards allowed the corpse of Harold to be removed to Waltham.
It is at least much more probable than that a falsehood should have
been allowed to pass unchallenged.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> This word, which is of course French but was adopted in English
with the same signification, definitely means a body of men, originally
mailed horsemen, drawn up together; but it implies nothing as to their
formation or strength. The usual practice was to form three; the vanguard,
which became ordinarily the right when in line of battle; the
rearguard, which similarly became the left; and the main battle or
centre. In the Latin chroniclers the equivalent term is generally
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acies</i>, which occasionally leads to some confusion in interpreting their
statements, as the classical sense of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acies</i> is order of battle, as contrasted
with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agmen</i>, order of march.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> It is suggested that this was a waggon, such as was habitually used
in Italy at an earlier date, and occasionally at least in England (as at
the battle of the Standard), to carry to battle the standard of the town.
The earl's standard certainly floated over it, and attracted prince
Edward's attention: and from the account given of the prisoners being
shut up in it, it would seem to have been very substantially built.
Montfort however would hardly have travelled in such a waggon, and
certainly the royalists imagined he was in it. There is no reason except
the silence of the chroniclers why there should not have been both a
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carroccio</i>, and also Montfort's own carriage.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> As he had not been crowned at Rome he had no right to use the
imperial title.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The name itself may very possibly be derived from the event.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> There are the remains of an ancient bridge at this spot, where so many
of the fugitives from the battle were cut to pieces that the meadow bears
the name of Dead Man's Eyot: but there is no mention of a bridge in
the authorities, so that probably the bridge was built later.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Here again I have given the account which seems to me most probable,
after study of the ground and of the authorities. Professor
Prothero, in his <cite>Life of Simon de Montfort</cite> (p. 339 note), gives the
different possibilities, and comes to a conclusion differing from mine on
one point only.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Philip <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr> was playing the same game, over-asserting his claims as

<p><a name="Footnote_18" id="Footnote_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> The use of the crossbow was solemnly condemned by the Lateran
Council of 1139: no reasons were given, but presumably it was thought

<p><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> This theory is so far as I know novel, and I put it forward as a
suggestion for what it may be worth. It explains, I venture to think,
the extraordinary success of the English tactics, and it contradicts no
ascertained facts. Every one who knows a little about drill will see
that in this formation the archers would be able to change the direction
of their shooting with perfect ease, and without interfering with each
other. The archers cannot have been on the flanks of the whole line
only, or their arrows, long as the range was, would not have told
across the whole front. They could obviously move with ease and
rapidity, and it is quite possible that they may have formed a line in
front of the dismounted men-at-arms, when no attack was impending,
as for instance to encounter the Genoese, and have fallen back to the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">herse</i> when the knights were seen preparing to charge.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_26" id="Footnote_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> There is no need to insist on the picturesque detail of the rain
which fell just before the battle having wetted the strings of the cross-bows,
while the English kept their bows under cover. It may well
have been true: but the range of the long-bow was always greater
than that of the cross-bow.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_27" id="Footnote_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> It is convenient to use this word for those who were fighting in the
English cause: but as a matter of fact two-thirds of the Black Prince's
men-at-arms were from among his Gascon subjects, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">servientes</i>
therefore in about the same proportion. The archers doubtless were
all, or nearly all, English: there is no trace of the long-bow except in
English armies.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_28" id="Footnote_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> I am indebted for these details, except so far as they are from my
own observation, to Colonel Babinet, a retired French officer living at
Poitiers, who has published in the <cite>Bulletin des Antiquaires de l'Ouest</cite>
a very elaborate memoir on the battle, which he has kindly supplemented
by private letters. His study of the topography has been
most minute, and his conclusions about it, so far as I can judge, are
entirely sound. If there were many investigators as patient and careful,
historians would find many battles less perplexing. Every one who
attempts to understand the battle of Poitiers must feel grateful to
Colonel Babinet, even if he does not accept all that gentleman's views
as to the course of events.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_29" id="Footnote_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> The Chandos Herald was in the service of Sir John Chandos, one
of the Black Prince's best officers. The herald was not apparently
present, but he obviously must have had every means of knowing about
the battle, in which Sir John fought; he did not, however, publish his
rhymed narrative till some thirty years later. Froissart, who was nineteen
years old in 1356, devoted his whole life to the work of his history; he
was familiar with courts, if not with camps, indefatigable in acquiring
information, but not critical. He too had ample opportunities of learning
all about the battle of Poitiers, at any rate from the English side. The
manuscripts of Froissart, however, vary greatly, which casts a certain
doubt over the trustworthiness of such details as are not given identically
in all. Baker was a clerk of Swinbrook in Oxfordshire: the last words
of his chronicle were written before the peace of Bretigny in 1360, so
that he was even more strictly contemporary than Froissart. Several
passages in his history, in which he makes very definite statements about
the tactics of the long-bow, prove that he, or his informant, understood
military matters well. None of them can have seen the ground, and
therefore no stress need be laid on minor inaccuracies of description.
Mistakes about the names of actors in the drama might easily be made:
all that can be said is that the writer who has made fewest errors has a
slightly better claim to general credibility. None of them can be
deemed likely to have deliberately misrepresented, or to have been
totally misinformed about the ground-work of the whole story. Yet
there is the fact, that their narratives are substantially contradictory.
Critical ingenuity may no doubt patch up some sort of superficial reconciliation
between them, but it can only be superficial. Under these
conditions I have no alternative but to follow the narrative which seems
to be most in accordance with the known facts. I am not ignorant of
the difficulties involved in this course, but my plan does not admit of a
full discussion of every point that might be raised. On the whole I
incline to discard the Chandos Herald, the more so because none of the
less detailed narratives support him, and as between Froissart and Baker,
to prefer the latter. My account of the actual battle will therefore
follow the chronicle of Baker of Swinbrook, in all matters in which he
and Froissart are completely at variance.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_30" id="Footnote_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> According to Baker, the prince began this movement <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum cariagiis</i>,
to which, however, there is no further reference. It is obviously possible
that the prince may have wished to get the baggage out of the way, and
therefore started it towards the Gu√© de l'Homme, and that he shifted his
troops in order to cover this from the French. If so, this would be the
element of truth in the Chandos Herald's narrative; but it does not in
any way remove the essential contradiction between the Chandos Herald
and the other authorities.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_31" id="Footnote_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> Froissart calls him Thomas lord of Berkeley, a young man in his
first battle, and says he was son of Sir Maurice Berkeley, who died at
Calais a few years before. Thomas the then lord of Berkeley, and
elder brother of that Sir Maurice, was in the battle, but he was a man of
over fifty, and he had his son Maurice with him for his first campaign.
That Baker should be right, and Froissart wrong, on a point peculiarly
within Froissart's province, is a striking incidental testimony to Baker's
trustworthiness.</p></div>

Henry <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr>, in confirming this to his half-brothers, had inserted words

because there seem to me to be no adequate materials for forming
a trustworthy estimate: but it is scarcely possible that the armies

the total given by chroniclers for Towton.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_42" id="Footnote_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> It is possible that the numbers are exaggerated, but there is no
reason for thinking so except the smallness of the battle-field; and if so
the exaggeration was on both sides alike, for it is certain that the
Lancastrian numbers preponderated. The Yorkist force is given at
49,000 by the authorities who put the Lancastrians at 60,000, both
totals being given before any fighting had taken place. What losses
had been incurred at Ferrybridge we are not told, and we can only
guess at the strength of the Yorkist rearguard: but the numbers with
which the battle began cannot have been very far from seven to four.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_43" id="Footnote_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> Sir John Ramsay, in his generally valuable work, <cite>Lancaster and
York</cite>, places Warwick's line along the high-road, where there is every
reason to believe that there was no hedge at all in the fifteenth century, for
the amazing reason that "from that position he could take the king's
troops in detail as they came out of the narrow street of Barnet," which
ended in the open heath half-a-mile off. It is true that he adds, "but
Edward always laughed at Warwick's strategy," by which presumably
he means tactics. Since all that Edward knew of Warwick's tactics was
that he had inspired, or at least shared in directing, the bold and skilful
tactics of Towton, he must have been very easily amused.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_44" id="Footnote_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> This fact alone is sufficient to disprove the Yorkist falsehood that

<p><a name="Footnote_46" id="Footnote_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> Sir John Ramsay must have seen the ground in winter, if he was
able to obtain a view of the whole position. In summer the trees,
which are none of them ancient, intercept a great deal. I should be
inclined to think that the Lancastrian line faced nearly south instead of
parallel to the modern road, as he places it: otherwise he seems to me
to have worked out the topographical details very well.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_47" id="Footnote_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> Curiously enough the earliest cannon seem to have been breechloading.
This mode of construction was however abandoned after a
time, either because the movable pieces did not fit properly, or because
they could not be made strong enough to stand the strain when gunpowder
came to be thoroughly explosive, in favour of muzzle-loading. In
modern warfare, until after the Crimean War, cannon were mere metal
tubes, with a touch-hole by which they were fired. Things have moved
fast since then. Of the millions of men now under military service, how
many have a clear idea of what "spiking a gun" meant?</p></div>

modern times of such a method of defence proving successful, and they
could not, from the nature of the case, be turned, and were never
assailed. The system on which the eastern frontier of France is now
defended is an instance of the same thing on the greatest possible scale.
There the flanks abut on neutral countries, and cannot therefore be
turned without violating the neutrality of either Belgium or Switzerland.
What it would cost to break through such a line cannot be
calculated, for it would depend on the effect, as yet untried, of modern
scientific developments in explosives, electric communication and the
like: but it can hardly be doubted that it could be done, if the
assailant were willing to pay the price.</p></div>

It was assumed that the young and inexperienced prince would be

that the prince developed a will of his own, and then the veteran was
helpless. How far Burgundy interfered before the battle, how far
Vend√¥me's well-known sluggishness except in action was responsible
for the French being thus surprised, is not quite clear: it will be seen
that in the actual battle Burgundy, by his alternate hesitation and
rashness, largely caused the French defeat.</p></div>

of Talavera was being fought, had wasted a large part of the military
strength of England. Sent as it was after Napoleon had forced Austria
again to sue for peace, and badly conducted, it was an inevitable failure.
This being the case, it is of course true that the men and material would
have been more usefully employed in the Peninsula. But it is by no
means equally clear that the original idea was faulty. Had even a
smaller force, energetically led, been despatched to the same point two
months earlier, when Napoleon was still absorbed in remedying his
failure at Aspern, the consequences might have been enormous. At the
very least it could have ruined Antwerp for purposes of naval construction;
and Napoleon deemed Antwerp, "a pistol pointed at the heart of
England," so valuable that in 1814, when almost at the last gasp, he
broke off negotiations for peace rather than cede Antwerp.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_73" id="Footnote_73"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73"><span class="label">[73]</span></a> In fact this proportion is in some sense far too high. Many of the

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_74" id="Footnote_74"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74"><span class="label">[74]</span></a> During the interval the duke of Wellington attended the famous
ball at Brussels given by the duchess of Richmond. It is always a
pity to spoil a romantic story; but the idea derived from the beautiful
description in 'Childe Harold,' and probably still believed by the
majority of those who have not studied the history, that the first intimation
of the French advance was given by the sound of distant cannon
heard at the ball, is contrary to all the facts. Wellington, having given
his orders, went to the ball in order to prevent alarm spreading in
Brussels: there was no firing during the night, none in fact, that could
have been heard at that distance, till the following afternoon.</p></div>

get over the fact that Napoleon took no steps, till it was far too late, to
summon him thither. The emperor knew that Wellington was standing
to fight, Grouchy could only guess. Suppose Gneisenau's suspicions
had been realised, and Wellington had retreated, and the cannon

He was not the kind of man to invent such a story, and his well-known
reticence about Waterloo would fully account for the incident remaining
unknown. On the other hand its intrinsic improbability is so great,
that it can hardly be accepted without cogent evidence. The testimony
however is altogether at second-hand, though quite precise enough to
warrant belief in an ordinary way; but it is obviously reasonable to
require something more for a story which would sound scarcely credible
if told of any commander-in-chief, and is specially at variance with
Wellington's cool and prudent disposition.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_81" id="Footnote_81"></a><a href="#FNanchor_81"><span class="label">[81]</span></a> This was entirely untrue in fact, as we have seen, but if the troops
at Hal had been on the field it would have been nearly true. Napoleon
could only have guessed, as the ground concealed a great part of Wellington's
army: this is not one of the deliberate falsehoods of which he
was only too commonly guilty.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_82" id="Footnote_82"></a><a href="#FNanchor_82"><span class="label">[82]</span></a> It is impossible to conjecture what put this idea into Ney's mind,
as the English army had bivouacked in very nearly the order of battle,
and had therefore not moved in the morning.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_83" id="Footnote_83"></a><a href="#FNanchor_83"><span class="label">[83]</span></a> It must be remembered that the range of the musket was very
short, so that the bullets could hardly do mischief in neighbouring
squares if they missed the cavalry.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_84" id="Footnote_84"></a><a href="#FNanchor_84"><span class="label">[84]</span></a> Readers who are curious in mendacity should read in Napoleon's
Correspondence the bulletin dated L√¢on, June 20, 1815, in which the
battles of Ligny and Waterloo are reported.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_85" id="Footnote_85"></a><a href="#FNanchor_85"><span class="label">[85]</span></a> Napoleon's Egyptian expedition is no real exception: it reached
its destination, but the battle of the Nile rendered it a total failure.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_86" id="Footnote_86"></a><a href="#FNanchor_86"><span class="label">[86]</span></a> It was said that Captain Nolan, the aide-de-camp who bore the
order, and who was well known from his writings to be a firm believer
in the power of cavalry to perform the most impossible feats, answered
Lord Lucan's objections by putting on the written words an interpretation
which Lord Raglan did not intend, and that Lord Lucan was
stung by implied imputation on his courage. Nolan however was shot
dead at the first moment of the charge, and there was consequently
no means of knowing what he could have said in his own defence.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_87" id="Footnote_87"></a><a href="#FNanchor_87"><span class="label">[87]</span></a> On the other side of the Tchernaya are some conspicuous remains
of ancient walls known as the ruins of Inkerman: from these the allies,
who found it convenient to have names for all portions of the ground
they were concerned with, named the opposite portion of the plateau
Mount Inkerman.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_88" id="Footnote_88"></a><a href="#FNanchor_88"><span class="label">[88]</span></a> It is not suggested that the French general at the outset, or later,
evaded his due share of the common duty: it is one of the evils of a
divided command that if a mistake is made in such a matter, as may
easily happen from imperfect information, obstacles to remedying it
arise from motives on both sides which are in themselves perfectly
reasonable.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_89" id="Footnote_89"></a><a href="#FNanchor_89"><span class="label">[89]</span></a> <cite>Decisive Battles of India.</cite></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_90" id="Footnote_90"></a><a href="#FNanchor_90"><span class="label">[90]</span></a> Englishmen in India made many mistakes at one time or another,
but there was always some one at hand to redeem the blunder, or else
they were saved by the reputation for audacity and invincibility due to
previous successes. They were guilty of many wrongful acts, but the
sufferers were the native princes whom they dispossessed: it is probably
no exaggeration to say that the rule of the English at its worst was
better than the best government of any native princes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_91" id="Footnote_91"></a><a href="#FNanchor_91"><span class="label">[91]</span></a> Colonel Malleson, in his <cite>Decisive Battles of India</cite>, gives a very clear
account of this remarkable feat, as well as of other similar battles, which
must be here passed over.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_92" id="Footnote_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92"><span class="label">[92]</span></a> In memory of this great victory the 39th bears on its colours the
motto "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Primus in Indis</span>."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_93" id="Footnote_93"></a><a href="#FNanchor_93"><span class="label">[93]</span></a> Sindia, Holkar, Bhonslay, are family appellations, but they serve
to identify three of the chief Mahratta states better than the individual
names of the successive rulers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_94" id="Footnote_94"></a><a href="#FNanchor_94"><span class="label">[94]</span></a> It is said that Wellesley had no information that the Kaitna was
fordable there, but that he inferred it from the fact of there being another
village opposite Assye, and no sort of bridge.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_95" id="Footnote_95"></a><a href="#FNanchor_95"><span class="label">[95]</span></a> The parallel is singularly exact between the conduct of the three
great Mahratta princes in 1803-4 and that of Austria, Russia and Prussia
in 1805-6. The two former made war on Napoleon, trying in vain to
induce Prussia to join them: after they had been decisively defeated at
Austerlitz, Prussia alone attacked the conqueror, with the natural result
of being still worse beaten at Jena.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_96" id="Footnote_96"></a><a href="#FNanchor_96"><span class="label">[96]</span></a> This method of attack in oblique order, or in √©chelon, is by some
writers treated as a great discovery, attributed to Frederick the Great
of Prussia. He certainly won by these tactics his most conspicuous
victory, Rossbach: but the method itself is in the nature of things, as
soon as generals begin to use their brains; it is but one way of bringing
superior force to bear on a vital point.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_97" id="Footnote_97"></a><a href="#FNanchor_97"><span class="label">[97]</span></a> There is a story that Major George Lawrence, then a prisoner,
communicated to his brother, and so to the commander-in-chief, the
surprise which the Sikh officers had expressed to him at the small use
made of the English artillery in previous battles. This may be true,
but there is no need to suppose that this influenced the battle of
Gujerat: any officer of ordinary judgment would have done at all times
what Gough did only in his last battle.</p></div>

<h3><a id="forthcoming"></a>ANNOUNCEMENTS</h3>


<h4>Poetry</h4>

<p><b>Rudyard Kipling.</b> BALLADS. By <span class="smcap">Rudyard Kipling</span>.
<i>Crown 8vo. Buckram. 6s.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">The announcement of a new volume of poetry from Mr. Kipling will excite wide
interest. The exceptional success of 'Barrack-Room Ballads,' with which this
volume will be uniform, justifies the hope that the new book too will obtain a
wide popularity.</div>


<p><b>W. E. Henley.</b> ENGLISH LYRICS. Selected and Edited by
<span class="smcap">W. E. Henley</span>. <i>Crown 8vo. Buckram. 6s.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Also 30 copies on hand-made paper. <i>Demy 8vo. ¬£1, 1s.</i></p>

<p>Also 15 copies on Japanese paper. <i>Demy 8vo. ¬£2, 2s.</i></p>

<p>Few announcements will be more welcome to lovers of English verse than the one
that Mr. Henley is bringing together into one book the finest lyrics in our
language. Robust and original the book will certainly be, and it will be produced
with the same care that made 'Lyra Heroica' delightful to the hand and
eye.</p></div>


<p><b>"Q"</b> THE GOLDEN POMP: A Procession of English Lyrics
from Surrey to Shirley, arranged by <span class="smcap">A. T. Quiller Couch</span>. <i>Crown
8vo. Buckram. 6s.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Also 30 copies on hand-made paper. <i>Demy 8vo. ¬£1, 1s.</i></p>

<p>Also 15 copies on Japanese paper. <i>Demy 8vo. ¬£2, 2s.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Quiller Couch's taste and sympathy mark him out as a born anthologist, and
out of the wealth of Elizabethan poetry he has made a book of great attraction.</p></div>


<p><b>H. C. Beeching.</b> LYRA SACRA: An Anthology of Sacred Verse.
Edited by <span class="smcap">H. C. Beeching</span>, M.A. <i>Crown 8vo. Buckram. 6s.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>This book will appeal to a wide public. Few languages are richer in serious verse
than the English, and the Editor has had some difficulty in confining his material
within his limits.</p></div>


<p><b>W. B. Yeats.</b> A BOOK OF IRISH VERSE. Edited by <span class="smcap">W. B.
Yeats</span>. <i>Crown 8vo. 3s. 6d.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>An anthology of Irish poetry selected by an editor whose own verse has won a considerable
reputation.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<h4>Fiction</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Messrs. Methuen</span> call attention to the fact that the following novels
are issued for the first time in one volume instead of in the old two and
three volume form.</p>


<p><b>Gilbert Parker.</b> THE TRAIL OF THE SWORD. By
<span class="smcap">Gilbert Parker</span>, Author of 'Pierre and his People,' etc. <i>Crown
8vo. 6s.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<i>Crown 8vo. 6s.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is a re-issue of Anthony Hope's first novel. It has been out of print for some
years, and in view of the great popularity of the author, it has been reprinted. It
is a story of political adventure in South America, and is rather in the style of
'The Prisoner of Zenda.'</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

F. Pinsent</span>, Author of 'Jenny's Case.' <i>Crown 8vo. 6s.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A story of modern life and thought, being a study of two opposite types&mdash;the
Christian and the Agnostic. Mrs. Pinsent's first book was very successful, and
the leading critics spoke of it as a remarkable and powerful story, and as one which
made them look forward with keen interest to the author's next book.</p></div>


<p><b>W. E. Norris.</b> THE DESPOTIC LADY AND OTHERS.
By <span class="smcap">W. E. Norris</span>, Author of 'The Rogue,' etc. <i>Crown 8vo. 6s.</i></p>

XIIIth.,' etc. <i>Crown 8vo. 6s.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is a historical romance of the time of the French Revolution by a writer whose
previous stories have been much praised for their 'romantic beauty and profound
interest and nervous strength of style.' Many critics noticed their 'wholesome
freshness' and 'vivid reproduction of the past.'</p></div>


<p><b>Gilbert Parker.</b> AN ADVENTURER OF THE NORTH.
By <span class="smcap">Gilbert Parker</span>, Author of 'Pierre and his People,' 'The
Translation of a Savage,' etc. <i>Crown 8vo. 6s.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

of 'Pretty Pierre.' Mr. Parker's first volume of Canadian stories was published
about two years ago, and was received with unanimous praise.</p></div>


<p><b>Philipps-Woolley.</b> THE QUEENSBERRY CUP. A Tale of
Adventure. By <span class="smcap">Clive Philipps Woolley</span>, Author of 'Snap,' Part
Author of 'Big Game Shooting,' Illustrated. <i>Crown 8vo. 6s.</i></p>

<h4>NEW EDITIONS</h4>

<p><b>Anthony Hope.</b> THE GOD IN THE CAR. By <span class="smcap">Anthony
Hope</span>, Author of 'A Change of Air,' etc. <i>Sixth Edition. Crown
8vo. 6s.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'This is, indeed, a very remarkable book, deserving of critical analysis impossible
within our limits; brilliant, but not superficial; well considered, but not elaborated;
constructed with the proverbial art that conceals, but yet allows itself to be
enjoyed by readers to whom fine literary method is a keen pleasure; true without
cynicism, subtle without affectation, humorous without strain, witty without
offence, inevitably sad, with an unmorose simplicity.'&mdash;<cite>World.</cite></p>

<p>'Immeasurably better than anything Mr. Hope has done before. A novel eminently
worth reading, full of brilliance, fire, and daring.'&mdash;<cite>Manchester Guardian.</cite></p>

<p>'Ruston is drawn with extraordinary skill, and Maggie Dennison with many subtle
strokes. The minor characters are clear cut. In short the book is a brilliant one.
"The God in the Car" is one of the most remarkable works in a year that has
given us the handiwork of nearly all our best living novelists.'&mdash;<cite>Standard.</cite></p></div>


<p><b>Baring Gould.</b> KITTY ALONE. By <span class="smcap">S. Baring Gould</span>,
Author of 'Mehalah,' 'Cheap Jack Zita,' etc. <i>Second Edition.
Crown 8vo. 6s.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'If any one wants&mdash;and in days when so much fiction is morbid and depressing it is
to the credit of human nature to believe that many persons must want&mdash;a book
brisk, clever, keen, healthy, humorous, and interesting, he can scarcely do better
than order "Kitty Alone."'&mdash;<cite>National Observer.</cite></p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Norris.</b> MATTHEW AUSTIN. By <span class="smcap">W. E. Norris</span>, Author of
'Mdle. de Mersac,' etc. <i>Second Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'It would be a strangely unsympathetic and cynical person who could read the life-story
of Matthew Austin, the singularly unselfish and gentle-natured country
doctor, without affectionate sympathy.... "Matthew Austin" may safely be
pronounced one of the most intellectually satisfactory and morally bracing novels
of the current year.'&mdash;<cite>Daily Telegraph.</cite></p></div>


<p><b>Mrs. Watson.</b> THIS MAN'S DOMINION. By the Author
of 'A High Little World.' <i>Second Edition. Crown 8vo. 3s. 6d.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'It is not a book to be read and forgotten on a railway journey, but it is rather a
study of the perplexing problems of life, to which the reflecting mind will
frequently return, even though the reader does not accept the solutions which the
author suggests. In these days, when the output of merely amusing novels is so
overpowering, this is no slight praise. There is an underlying depth in the story
which reminds one, in a lesser degree, of the profundity of George Eliot, and
"This Man's Dominion" is by no means a novel to be thrust aside as exhausted at
one perusal.'&mdash;<cite>Dundee Advertiser.</cite></p></div>


<p><b>Richard Pryce.</b> WINIFRED MOUNT. By <span class="smcap">Richard Pryce</span>.
<i>Second Edition. Crown 8vo. 3s. 6d.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The 'Sussex Daily News' called this book '<em>a delightful story</em>,' and said that the
writing was '<em>uniformly bright and graceful</em>.' The 'Daily Telegraph' said that the
author was a '<em>deft and elegant story-teller</em>,' and that the book was '<em>an extremely
clever story, utterly untainted by pessimism or vulgarity</em>.'</p></div>


<h4>History</h4>

<p><b>Gibbon.</b> THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN
EMPIRE. By <span class="smcap">Edward Gibbon</span>. A New Edition, edited with
Notes and Appendices and Maps by <span class="smcap">J. B. Bury</span>, M.A., Fellow of
Trinity College, Dublin. <i>In Seven Volumes. Crown 8vo.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The time seems to have arrived for a new edition of Gibbon's great work&mdash;furnished
with such notes and appendices as may bring it up to the standard of recent historical
research. Edited by a scholar who has made this period his special study,
and issued in a convenient form and at a moderate price, this edition should fill
an obvious void.</p></div>


<p><b>Horsburgh.</b> THE CAMPAIGN OF WATERLOO. By <span class="smcap">E. L.
S. Horsburgh</span>, M.A. With Plans. <i>Crown 8vo. 5s.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

George</span>, M.A., Fellow of New College, Oxford. <i>With numerous
Plans. Crown 8vo. 6s.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This book, by a well-known authority on military history, will be an important
contribution to the literature of the subject. All the great battles of English
history are fully described, and connecting chapters carefully treat of the changes
wrought by new discoveries and developments.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Oscar Browning.</b> THE AGE OF THE CONDOTTIERI: A
Short History of Italy from 1409 to 1530. By <span class="smcap">Oscar Browning</span>,
M.A., Fellow of King's College, Cambridge. <i>Crown 8vo. 5s.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This book is a continuation of Mr. Browning's 'Guelphs and Ghibellines,' and the
two works form a complete account of Italian history from 1250 to 1530.</p></div>


<h4>Biography</h4>

<p><b>Southey.</b> ENGLISH SEAMEN (Howard, Clifford, Hawkins,
Drake, Cavendish). By <span class="smcap">Robert Southey</span>. Edited, with an
Introduction, by <span class="smcap">David Hannay</span>. <i>Crown 8vo. 6s.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is a reprint of some excellent biographies of Elizabethan seamen, written by
Southey and never republished. They are practically unknown, and they deserve,
and will probably obtain, a wide popularity.</p></div>


<p><b>Cutts.</b> AUGUSTINE OF CANTERBURY. By <span class="smcap">E. L.

and <span class="smcap">F. R. Oliphant</span>. With Illustrations and Maps. <i>Crown 8vo.
6s.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A volume dealing with the French Riviera from Toulon to Mentone. Without falling
within the guide-book category, the book will supply some useful practical
information, while occupying itself chiefly with descriptive and historical matter.
A special feature will be the attention directed to those portions of the Riviera,
which, though full of interest and easily accessible from many well-frequented
spots, are generally left unvisited by English travellers, such as the Maures
Mountains and the St. Tropez district, the country lying between Cannes, Grasse
and the Var, and the magnificent valleys behind Nice. There will be several
original illustrations.</p></div>


<p><b>Shedlock.</b> THE PIANOFORTE SONATA: Its Origin and
Development. By <span class="smcap">J. S. Shedlock</span>. <i>Crown 8vo. 5s.</i></p>

<p>This is a practical and not unduly technical account of the Sonata treated historically.
It contains several novel features, and an account of various works little
known to the English public.</p></div>


<p><b>Dixon.</b> A PRIMER OF TENNYSON. By <span class="smcap">W. M. Dixon</span>,
M. A., Professor of English Literature at Mason College. <i>Fcap. 8vo.
1s. 6d.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This book consists of (1) a succinct but complete biography of Lord Tennyson;
(2) an account of the volumes published by him in chronological order, dealing with
the more important poems separately; (3) a concise criticism of Tennyson in his
various aspects as lyrist, dramatist, and representative poet of his day; (4) a
bibliography. Such a complete book on such a subject, and at such a moderate
price, should find a host of readers.</p></div>

<h4>English Classics</h4>

<p>Edited by <span class="smcap">W. E. Henley</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Messrs. Methuen propose to publish, under this title, a series of the masterpieces of
the English tongue, which, while well within the reach of the average buyer, shall
be at once an ornament to the shelf of him that owns, and a delight to the eye of
him that reads.</p>

<p>The series, of which Mr. William Ernest Henley is the general editor, will confine
itself to no single period or department of literature. Poetry, fiction, drama,
biography, autobiography, letters, essays&mdash;in all these fields is the material of
many goodly volumes.</p>

<p>The books, which are designed and printed by Messrs. Constable, will be issued in
two editions&mdash;(1) A small edition, on the finest Japanese vellum, demy 8vo, 21<i>s.</i> a
volume nett; (2) The popular edition on laid paper, crown 8vo, buckram, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a
volume.</p></div>

<p>The following are some notices which have appeared on 'TRISTRAM
SHANDY,' the first volume of the series:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Very dainty volumes are these; the paper, type, and light green binding are all
very agreeable to the eye. "Simplex munditiis" is the phrase that might be
applied to them. So far as we know, Sterne's famous work has never appeared in
a guise more attractive to the connoisseur than this.'&mdash;<cite>Globe.</cite></p>

<p>'The book is excellently printed by Messrs. Constable on good paper, and being
divided into two volumes, is light and handy without lacking the dignity of a
classic.'&mdash;<cite>Manchester Guardian.</cite></p>

<p>'This new edition of a great classic might make an honourable appearance in any
library in the world. Printed by Constable on laid paper, bound in most artistic
and restful-looking fig-green buckram, with a frontispiece portrait and an introduction
by Mr. Charles Whibley, the book might well be issued at three times its
present price.'&mdash;<cite>Irish Independent.</cite></p>

Other Verses. By <span class="smcap">Rudyard Kipling</span>. <i>Seventh Edition. Crown
8vo. 6s.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A Special Presentation Edition, bound in white buckram, with
extra gilt ornament. <i>7s. 6d.</i></p>

<p>'Mr. Kipling's verse is strong, vivid, full of character.... Unmistakable genius
rings in every line.'&mdash;<cite>Times.</cite></p>

<p>'The disreputable lingo of Cockayne is henceforth justified before the world; for a
man of genius has taken it in hand, and has shown, beyond all cavilling, that in
its way it also is a medium for literature. You are grateful, and you say to
yourself, half in envy and half in admiration: "Here is a <em>book</em>; here, or one is a
Dutchman, is one of the books of the year."'&mdash;<cite>National Observer.</cite></p>

<p>'"Barrack-Room Ballads" contains some of the best work that Mr. Kipling has
ever done, which is saying a good deal. "Fuzzy-Wuzzy," "Gunga Din," and
"Tommy," are, in our opinion, altogether superior to anything of the kind that
English literature has hitherto produced.'&mdash;<cite>Athen√¶um.</cite></p>

<p>'These ballads are as wonderful in their descriptive power as they are vigorous in
their dramatic force. There are few ballads in the English language more
stirring than "The Ballad of East and West," worthy to stand by the Border
ballads of Scott.'&mdash;<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>

<p>'The ballads teem with imagination, they palpitate with emotion. We read them
with laughter and tears; the metres throb in our pulses, the cunningly ordered
words tingle with life; and if this be not poetry, what is?'&mdash;<cite>Pall Mall Gazette.</cite></p></div>

<p>'The stories are old friends&mdash;Cinderella, Bluebeard, the Three Bears, and so on&mdash;in

give cannot but have the best effect in the formation of a good taste.'&mdash;<cite>Scotsman.</cite></p>

<p>'Mr. Baring Gould has done a good deed, and is deserving of gratitude, in re-writing
in honest, simple style the old stories that delighted the childhood of "our

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'A most splendid and fascinating book on a subject of undying interest. The great
feature of the book is the use the author has made of the existing portraits of the
Caesars, and the admirable critical subtlety he has exhibited in dealing with this
line of research. It is brilliantly written, and the illustrations are supplied on a
scale of profuse magnificence.'&mdash;<cite>Daily Chronicle.</cite></p>

story cast on strong lines, containing dramatic possibilities, vivid and sympathetic
descriptions of Nature, and a wealth of ingenious imagery.'&mdash;<cite>Speaker.</cite></p>

<p>'That whatever Mr. Baring Gould writes is well worth reading, is a conclusion that
may be very generally accepted. His views of life are fresh and vigorous, his
language pointed and characteristic, the incidents of which he makes use are
striking and original, his characters are life-like, and though somewhat exceptional
people, are drawn and coloured with artistic force. Add to this that his
descriptions of scenes and scenery are painted with the loving eyes and skilled
hands of a master of his art, that he is always fresh and never dull, and under
such conditions it is no wonder that readers have gained confidence both in his
power of amusing and satisfying them, and that year by year his popularity
widens.'&mdash;<cite>Court Circular.</cite></p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'The tender reverence of the treatment and the imaginative beauty of the writing
have reconciled us to the daring of the conception, and the conviction is forced on
us that even so exalted a subject cannot be made too familiar to us, provided it be
presented in the true spirit of Christian faith. The amplifications of the Scripture
narrative are often conceived with high poetic insight, and this "Dream of the
World's Tragedy" is, despite some trifling incongruities, a lofty and not inadequate
paraphrase of the supreme climax of the inspired narrative.'&mdash;<cite>Dublin

<p><b>Anthony Hope.</b> THE GOD IN THE CAR. By <span class="smcap">Anthony
Hope</span>, Author of 'A Change of Air,' etc. <i>Sixth Edition. Crown
8vo. 6s.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'"The God In the Car" is so good, so immeasurably better than anything
Mr. Hope has done before in the way of a novel of contemporary manners, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>there seems no reason why he should not eventually reach that place in the front
rank, which he has evidently set before himself as his goal. "The God in the
Car" is a novel eminently worth reading, full of brilliance, fire, and daring, and
above all full of promise of something still better in the future, something which
will render criticism superfluous.'&mdash;<cite>Manchester Guardian.</cite></p>

<p>'Ruston is drawn with extraordinary skill, and Maggie Dennison with many subtle
strokes. The minor characters are clear cut. In short the book is a brilliant one.
"The God in the Car" is one of the most remarkable works in a year that has
given us the handiwork of nearly all our best living novelists.'&mdash;<cite>Standard.</cite></p>

<p>'A very remarkable book, deserving of critical analysis impossible within our limit;
brilliant, but not superficial; well considered, but not elaborated; constructed
with the proverbial art that conceals, but yet allows itself to be enjoyed by
readers to whom fine literary method is a keen pleasure; true without cynicism,
subtle without affectation, humorous without strain, witty without offence, inevitably
sad, with an unmorose simplicity.'&mdash;<cite>The World.</cite></p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is a re-issue of Anthony Hope's first novel. It has been out of print for some

is a story of political adventure in South America, and is rather in the style of

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'The reader will find in it some perfectly constructed stories, the memory of which
will haunt him long after he has laid it down. The author again reveals himself
as a keenly sympathetic observer of life and a master of vigorous impressive narrative.'&mdash;<cite>Yorkshire
Post.</cite></p>

<p>'The book is, indeed, composed of leaves from life', and is far and away the best
view that has been vouchsafed us behind the scenes of the consulting-room. It is
very superior to "The Diary of a late Physician."'&mdash;<cite>Illustrated London News.</cite></p>

<p>'Dr. Doyle wields a cunning pen, as all the world now knows. His deft touch is
seen to perfection in these short sketches&mdash;these "facts and fancies of medical
life," as he calls them. Every page reveals the literary artist, the keen observer,
the trained delineator of human nature, its weal and its woe.'&mdash;<cite>Freeman's Journal.</cite></p>

<p>'These tales are skilful, attractive, and eminently suited to give relief to the mind
of a reader in quest of distraction.'&mdash;<cite>Athen√¶um.</cite></p>

<p>'The book is one to buy as well as to borrow, and that it will repay both buyer and
borrower with interest.'&mdash;<cite>Sunday Times.</cite></p>

<p>'It is quite safe to assert that no one who begins to read 'Round the Red Lamp'
will voluntarily lay the book aside until every one of its fascinating pages has
been perused.'&mdash;<cite>Lady.</cite></p>

<p>A cheaper edition of a book which won instant popularity. No unfavourable review
occurred, and most critics spoke in terms of enthusiastic admiration. The 'Westminster

<p>'Mr. W. E. Norris is always happy in his delineation of everyday experiences, but
rarely has he been brighter or breezier than in "Matthew Austin." The pictures

<p>'The characters are delineated by the author with his characteristic skill and
vivacity, and the story is told with that ease of manners and Thackerayean insight
which give strength of flavour to Mr. Norris's novels. No one can depict
the Englishwoman of the better classes with more subtlety.'&mdash;<cite>Glasgow Herald.</cite></p>

<p>'Mr. Norris has drawn a really fine character in the Duke of Hurstbourne, at once
unconventional and very true to the conventionalities of life, weak and strong in
